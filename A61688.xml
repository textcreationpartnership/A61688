            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HE that endeavours to give an Account of ſo many mens behaviour as muſt needs be concerned in three Active Campaigns, is ſure to want neither Envy, nor Detraction; ſome finding fault with one thing, and ſome with another; ſo that it is impoſſible to expect or hope for the pleaſing of all Parties; nor indeed is it fit to endeavour it: The Reputations of men however are tender things, and therefore every prudent man, when he has occaſion to touch them, will be careful to do it very nicely. And yet it happens often to thoſe that write, that either through heedleſneſs they diſoblige ſome that do not deſerve it; or out of raſhneſs provoke others that may make them repent it; in which Caſes there ſometimes needs an excuſe for Offences gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, even where they never were intended.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, and a great many other Conſiderations, have not frighted me from medling with a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, wherein not a few of the moſt eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb facs="tcp:99346:6"/> of our Age have born a part; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe I find it has laid all this while negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and not any one as yet, beſides my ſelf, has undertaken it (except in ſome ſmall Collections out of our publick News.) I endeavoured two years ago to give the World a true Account of the Matter of Fact, as it happened the two firſt Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns, and how Matters then ſtood with both the Armies. And this bore the name of, <hi>An Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Hiſtory of the Affairs of</hi> Ireland <hi>the Two laſt Years;</hi> wherein I was deſirous to make the Book it ſelf anſwer its Title; and alſo to ſhew the great hopes there was then in gaining the whole Kingdom in a ſhort time after; which I am next about to ſhew you how it fell out, ſo far as I have been able to make an enquiry into it. But ſince it's probable that the Firſt Part has not reached ſo many Hands as this may, I have here repeated ſome of the moſt material Paſſages from the beginning, and added ſome few things that I have been informed of ſince I writ the other; tho my main Deſign is to be as particular in the laſt Campaign, as I have been formerly in the other two, which was done by way of Journal; as this is alſo, when you come to the end of the Abridgment: In all which put together, you have the Principal Occurrences from Duke <hi>Scon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>'s landing in that Kingdom, till Their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
<pb facs="tcp:99346:6"/> Proclamation, dated at <hi>Kenſington, March</hi> the 3<hi>d,</hi> 1691/2. Declaring that War to be ended; with ſome further Obſervations about the paſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Circumſtances of that Nation.</p>
            <p>The Blood ſpilt, and Treaſure ſpent, in this unhappy War, has doubtleſs been a ſufficient Grievance to both Kingdoms; yet we have no great reaſon to be out of humour at it now, there being at that time an apparent neceſſity for it; by which the War is alſo removed to a greater diſtance, till we can gain a Firm, Honourable, and Laſting Peace from abroad, that ſo Their Majeſties may be at leiſure to free their own Dominions from the Vices and Corruptions of a Licentious Age.</p>
            <p>But I am no Politician; and therefore what I have to offer in behalf of this Undertaking of mine, is only this; That it was the honour I had for the Memory of that Great Man Duke <hi>Scon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> and a deſire to ſet the World right at that time in their Judgments, how Matters ſtood with both Armies, which put me firſt upon the Deſign. And the favourable Acceptance that my firſt endeavours met with in <hi>Ireland,</hi> has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged me to continue them; though I muſt be ſo grateful as to own the kind Reſentments of ſome in my own Countrey alſo, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe of my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:99346:7"/> has been pleaſed, not only to commend the Undertaking, but to honour me with the Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome of my Papers with his own Hand, and alſo with an Account of the reaſons for ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, that before I was in the dark for want of.</p>
            <p>I hate to clog Truth with any Artifice; nor is there any occaſion for ſuch an endeavour, ſuppoſel had an inclination or skill to do it; for whilſt things are freſh in every ones memory, if a man ſhould be guilty of any notable and wilful Miſtake that way, there are a great many able to find it out. I have done the Subject therefore no injury, but by my own defects, which by this means I have expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the publick Cenſure of all People.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen a great part of the moſt notable Adventures however, from the beginning to the end, and want only skill to give a good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. By-ſtanders commonly ſee more than thoſe actually ingaged in Battel; here eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is tied to his Poſt, and minds the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only that is before him; when thoſe that are Lookers on, have nothing elſe to do but to obſerve: So that wherein I have been defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in this Point, is more for want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than Opportunity; and thoſe that are Judges in the Military Art, I hope will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me where I have made uſe of Terms that are not proper to that Profeſſion. But beſides
<pb facs="tcp:99346:7"/> what Obſervations I have been able to make my ſelf, I have had the benefit of ſeveral <hi>Diaries,</hi> and ſome of thoſe writ with good skill; I have look'd over all our Publick Accounts too, and been freely allowed the advantage of ſeveral Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Papers and Letters at the Secretary of War's Office, and other places; ſo that you have all that I know of the matter; and I hope it's no crime in me to know no more than I do; tho I will not warrant what I have ſaid from being guilty of ſeveral Miſtakes; for men relate things generally as they conceive 'em; and of many that have ſeen the ſame thing, few there are that relate it alike, every one ſpeaking of it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Notions, or as his mind is turned by clear or confuſed Conceptions; which alone may be ſufficient Encouragement to any judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Undertaker to be at the pains to compleat the Work, eſpecially when they ſee a thing of that Importance ſo ſlovenly managed: Tho I am the firſt that has chalked out the way, and have ſome Reaſons to believe, that whoever writes afterwards upon this Subject, will take more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Truſt than I have done.</p>
            <p>There is already publiſhed <hi>An Account of the State of the Proteſtants in</hi> Ireland <hi>under the late King's Reign;</hi> moſt of whom found it true by experience what is there at large related; which is the reaſon that
<pb facs="tcp:99346:8"/> at this day in <hi>Ireland</hi> you'l find no <hi>Jacobites</hi> but <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Some of whom I hear have made it their boaſt, That they have anſwered that Book; but I'm ſufficiently aſſured. That the Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor who writ it, is able to make it good: And what credit one of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith, and an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Evidence too, will gain by contradicting pure Matter of Fact, any ſober man may eaſily fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee. Sir <hi>Richard Cox</hi> has alſo been pleaſed to ſay, That he will oblige the world with a Third Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of his Hiſtory; upon which Conſiderations I have ſaid little of things before our own Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and afterwards have for the moſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined my ſelf to matters relating to the Army, even in which, if we take things as they riſe, there have been ſeveral Actions on our ſide, that have made but an indifferent Figure to us, who poſſibly did not ſtand in a good light, and ſo could not diſcern the true Reaſons of things; only we ought to be ſatisfied, that Publick Authority is not to be ſubject to the private Paſſions and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the people; nor the Laws of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either in Armies or elſewhere, to the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of every pretender.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps may ask what part of our Army had the greateſt Intereſt in the Glory of thoſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories which we have gained in that Kingdom,
<pb facs="tcp:99346:8"/> we being compoſed of ſo many different Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which muſt needs create Emulation, if not Envy it ſelf? It has been an Obſervation before my time, That all people generally have a good opinion of themſelves, and magnifie their own Countrey-men either as to Courage or Cuſtoms, though it be often without the leaſt ſhew of Reaſon: The <hi>Turks</hi> you ſee contemn us, and we them as much: The <hi>Grecians</hi> in former times called all the world but themſelves <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and now they are as much deſpiſed by moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: The <hi>Italians</hi> deride the <hi>French,</hi> and they again ſcoff at the <hi>Italians:</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> laugh at all, and every Countrey again at them: We call the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Wild and Rude, and they think to be even with us in calling us <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churles, and other Names of Reproach; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were worſted, yet their Officers would confidently affirm, That their men had as much Courage as thoſe that beat them. The <hi>Danes</hi> too magnified their own Actions, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> did as much for themſelves; yet if you'l grant me but for this once to be impartial, I can affirm by often-repeated experience, That I never ſaw any thing contemn Death to that degree, (and that too in all ſhapes) as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Soldiers did upon all occaſions. And
<pb facs="tcp:99346:9"/> if any endeavour to take the greateſt part of the Glory of that War from them, they do them not that Juſtice which the Merit of their Cauſe deſerves: Not that other people did not behave themſelves very well, but the Numbers of no other Nation were equal to ours; or if they had, can I by any means allow they could have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done us.</p>
            <p>I have done our Enemies all the Juſtice in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point, that the Merit of their Cauſe would bear, and that too from ſeveral of their own mouths, upon whoſe Credit I have related many Circumſtances. And as to our own ſide, I am very far from having the leaſt prejudice to the Perſon of any man; nor if I had, could I ever perſuade my ſelf to take ſo poor a Revenge, (if any) as to aſperſe him unjuſtly; this would be my own loſs, and not his: So that if any man happen to be injured by what I have ſaid, (though there's a great difference between being <hi>wronged</hi> and <hi>offended)</hi> I declare it no wilful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and ſhall be very ready to ask his Pardon; which I will not do to any man, for ſaying what I know to be true.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:99346:9"/>
            <p> But what I am moſt ſorry for is, That I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not but a great many Gentlemen have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very well in this War, tho it has been my Misfortune not to know their Names; and yet I hope that Time and a more diligent Enquiry will do them Juſtice.</p>
            <p>What I have writ towards the end of the Book, concerning the paſt and preſent States of that Countrey, was done with the reſt in <hi>April</hi> laſt, when the noiſe of the <hi>French</hi> Deſcent filled every ones ears; and the ſame diſcourſe being now revived, I ſhall let it ſtand as it is, with this Remark, That though I am no Prophet, yet if they do make an Attempt, I hope they'l have the ſame Fate that others have had before them.</p>
            <p>Whatever my Account of theſe matters may be, yet the Maps that I have inſerted, which il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the principal Battels and Sieges, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, and coſt no ſmall Pains and Charges to bring them to that perfection: But when I read over theſe Papers my ſelf, I find the Stile of the whole harſh and unpleaſant; which muſt needs be much more ſo to others, eſpecially in an Age wherein ſo many Learned and Great Men have
<pb facs="tcp:99346:10"/> brought our Language to ſo great Perfection: But all the hopes I have is, That the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men are apteſt to put the moſt favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon a private man's Endeavour, and will be ready to pardon a great many Defects in one that means well: and as for all the Cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious men in the world, I ſhall not be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at what they ſay.</p>

Even the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves, when they were far from being one of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99346:14"/> moſt Reformed Nations in the World, had their Bards, and Ballad-makers, who have taken no ſmall pains in their way to render the Chieftains of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as famous as others. Nay, the Greateſt Generals and Emperors have in the midſt of their Conqueſts imployed ſome of their time to leave the immortal Memory of their own, and other Great Mens Actions in writing; the omiſſion of which has been a great defect in the middle Age of the World, ſince thoſe are commonly the moſt Competent Judges of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Affairs, and ableſt to give a true Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>But becauſe in this Fighting Age, wherein we now live, their time is other ways imployed; and Great Men have ſcarce leiſure to read, much leſs to write great Books; we muſt be contented to take the beſt Accounts we can get of their Actions from meaner Hands, ſuch as have been Eye-witneſſes of them, or at leaſt have good grounds for what they tell us. And foraſmuch as the Diſturbances in <hi>Ireland</hi> have made ſo great a noiſe in the Ears of all <hi>Europe,</hi> whilſt they laſted; and my ſelf as a conſtant Attendant on their Majeſties Army, having been an Eye-witneſs to the moſt Remarkable Occurrences; I ſhall not ſcruple to tell the World all I know; which as it is for the moſt part little elſe but the bare matter of Fact, I hope it may not be deſpiſed, though it come from ſo mean a Hand, and in ſo homely a Dreſs.</p>
               <p>I need not trouble the Reader with a long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about the Occaſion of the War; The general Averſion of the People of <hi>England</hi> to Popery, and their being ill treated by a Prince of that Perſuaſion, made ſuch a ſudden Change in that Kingdom, as the like never happened before in any Age or Countrey: But <hi>Ireland</hi> was under different Circumſtances; the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99346:14"/> 
                  <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Party being there by much the ſtronger (at leaſt more numerous) of whom my Lord <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connell</hi> had, during the late King's Reign, been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling an Army that might be ready on all Occaſions to maintain the Popiſh Intereſt, by which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in that Kingdom were brought upon the very brink of Ruine, and then forced moſt of them to fly from thence to ſecure their Lives againſt an Inſolent and ungovernable <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army; who by order from the Government, ſeized upon all the Horſes and Arms they could find in the Hands of the Proteſtants through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom, and made all poſſible Preparations to reſiſt a powerful Army from <hi>England,</hi> which was but reaſonable to look for, ſince it's ſo inconſiſtent with the Laws, Intereſt and Policy of this Kingdom, to have <hi>Ireland</hi> in any other hands but their own.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> the Late King, with about <note place="margin">The Late King lands in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> 1800 men from <hi>France,</hi> landed at <hi>Kinſale</hi> in the Weſt of <hi>Ireland.</hi> And on the <hi>14th</hi> ſeveral of the Northern Proteſtants that had betaken themſelves to Arms, were routed at a place called <hi>Drummore,</hi> by Lieut.

He had with him at <hi>Drummore</hi> about 2000 of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſtanding Army, and nigh as many Rapareers, though he killed but few of the Proteſtants, they making a Running Fight of it, as others alſo did at <hi>Killileigh, Claudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord,</hi> and ſome other Places; ſeveral flying into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> though the moſt reſolute amongſt them went towards <hi>London-Derry,</hi> where in a ſhort time they were actually beſieged by the greateſt part of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99346:15"/>
               <p> And then the <hi>Iriſh</hi> make Preparations for the ſitting of their Parliament, which was on the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1689. wherein all the mere <hi>Iriſh</hi> were admitted as <note place="margin">An <hi>Iriſh</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> Members; and moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, Gentry, Clergy, and ſubſtantial Tradeſmen of that Kingdom, were attainted by name; their Eſtates and Goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declared forfeited, if they returned not by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day, which to the greateſt part was next to an impoſſibility.</p>
               <p>There were ſome Proteſtants however in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament who endeavoured to do their Abſent Brethren, and the Proteſtant Intereſt, all the faithful ſervice ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; particularly the Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> who made ſeveral excellent Speeches in the Houſe of Lords in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to their Proceedings; but the Current was then too ſtrong to be ſtopt, and whoever endeavoured it, their Attempts were fruitleſs.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ALL People were now big with hopes of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's coming for <hi>Ireland,</hi> who left <hi>Kenſington</hi> the Fourth of <hi>June</hi> 1690. took Shipping at <hi>Hylake</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">His Majeſty Lands in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </note> on the <hi>12th;</hi> and on the <hi>14th,</hi> being <hi>Saturday,</hi> he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about Four in the Afternoon at <hi>Carigfergus;</hi> from whence, being upon the Road to <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> he was met by the General, Major-General <hi>Kirk,</hi> and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Officers of the Army that were there, expecting His Majeſty's Landing: And that Evening landed his Highneſs Prince <hi>George,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> Earl of <hi>Scarborough,</hi> Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> my Lord <hi>Overkirk,</hi> my Lord <hi>Sidney,</hi> with a great many other Perſons of Quality, ſome of them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99346:29"/> Officers in the Army, and others Voluntiers. The two following days His Majeſty was attended by moſt of the Nobily, Clergy, and other Gentlemen inhabiting that part of the Kingdom. He was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented alſo with an Addreſs from the Epiſcopal Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and another from ſeveral Presbyterian Miniſters, both which His Majeſty received very graciouſly.</p>
               <p>The King ſtayed at <hi>Belfaſt</hi> till <hi>Thurſday</hi> the <hi>19th;</hi> and having ſet out a Proclamation to encourage all People, of what Perſuaſion ſoever, to live peaceably at home, His Majeſty went to <hi>Hilsburrough,</hi> giving Ordes for his Army to take the Field. And on the <note place="margin">All our Army takes the Field.</note> 
                  <hi>22th</hi> His Majeſty Encampt at <hi>Loughbritland</hi> with that part of the Army which had their Rendezvouz there, and never laid out of the Camp (except upon his Journey from <hi>Caruck</hi> to <hi>Dublin),</hi> after that, during his ſtay in <hi>Ireland.</hi> That Morning a Party of Two hundred Foot and Dragoons going from <hi>Newry</hi> towards <hi>Dundalk</hi> to diſcover the Enemy (who ere this had taken the Field, and then lay encamped there) our men fell into an Ambuſcade of about Four hundred of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> at a narrow Paſs upon a Bog, nigh a place called the <hi>Four-mile Houſe,</hi> by which we loſt Twenty two of our Party, and Captain <hi>Farlow,</hi> with another Officer, were taken Priſoners, but the Enemy did not gain much by this Attempt, for they loſt more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than we did. Captain <hi>Farlow</hi> was the firſt who gave the Late King a certain Account of King <hi>William</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for till then he would not believe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the <hi>27th,</hi> our whole Army joined at <hi>Dundalk,</hi> making in all about Thirty ſix thouſand, though the World called us at leaſt a third part more: The <hi>Iriſh,</hi> at our approach hither, had removed to the <hi>Boyn;</hi> And on <hi>Sunday</hi> the <hi>29th,</hi> our Army marched beyond
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99346:30"/> 
                  <hi>Ardee,</hi> which the Enemy had fortified much after the ſame manner as they had done <hi>Dundalk;</hi> and early next morning our whole Army moved toward the <note place="margin">The Army marches to the <hi>Boyn.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Boyne,</hi> making their Approaches very finely. After ſome time His Majeſty ſent down ſmall Parties of Horſe to diſcover the Ways, and then rid towards the Paſs at <hi>Old Bridge,</hi> having a full view of the Enemy's Camp as he went along; His Majeſty ſtopt ſome time at <hi>Old Bridge</hi> to obſerve the Enemy's Poſture, and then going a little further, His Majeſty alighted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh himſelf, and ſate nigh an hour upon the Graſs; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time the Enemy brought down two Field-pieces under Covert of a ſmall Party of Horſe, and planted them at the Corner of a Hedge undiſcovered; and when His Majeſty, the Prince, and the reſt were mounted again, and riding ſoftly the ſame way back, their Cannonier let fly, and at the ſecond Shot was ſo near the killing His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, <note place="margin">His Majeſty's narrow Eſcape from a Great Shot.</note> as that the Bullet ſlanted upon his Right Shoulder, took away a piece of his Coat, and ſtruck off the Skin; which might have been a fatal Blow to his Army, and Kingdoms too, if the Great Creator of the World, who orders and governs all things, had not been at his Right Hand, where he always is, and, I hope, will be, as well for the defence of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Sacred Perſon, as the good of thoſe he has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to protect.</p>
               <p>The Enemy then fired thoſe two Pieces as faſt as they could charge and diſcharge, doing ſome damage amongſt our Horſe that were drawing up before them, which made the King give Orders for his Horſe to rein a little backwards, and have the advantage of a Riſing Ground between them and the Cannon.</p>
               <p>About Three a Clock in the Afternoon ſome of our Field-pieces came up, which were immediately plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then played into the Enemy's Camp: the reſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99346:30"/> of the day was ſpent in our Army's Encamping, and in firing Great Guns one upon another from ſeveral Batteries, without any extraordinary loſs</p>
               <p>Whether His Majeſty had already an Account of what had happened to the Confederate Army at <hi>Flerus,</hi> I am not able to give an Account; but it's probable he had ſome intimation of it; ſince in a Council of War held that night, His Majeſty ſeemed poſitive in paſſing the River next day, and therefore gave Orders for his Army to be ready accordingly.</p>
               <p>The late King had likewiſe another Council of War on his ſide the River, wherein all the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers agreed, (which was the only time they ever did ſo before or after), Not to give us Battel, but to march off in the night, and then retreat towards <hi>Ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi> and <hi>Limerick</hi> filling all their Towns that were tenable, as they went, with ſufficient Gariſons to defend them. And their reaſon was this; as ſoon as Sir <hi>Cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley Shovel</hi> with his Squadron of Men of War had ſeen the King ſafe in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he was ordered to ſail immediately, and join my Lord <hi>Torrington,</hi> then at Sea with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet; which the <hi>French</hi> having notice of, and that all our Tranſport Ships with our Proviſions and other Neceſſaries for War, were left at <hi>Carigfergus-Bay</hi> with little or no Convoy, and would have Orders to coaſt along as the Army marched, they reſolved to ſend Ten ſmall Frigats and Twelve Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers into the Channel, and burn all our Ships; which if it had been done then, our Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>England</hi> had been in a manner cut off, and our Army forced to ſubſiſt upon the Countrey, or ſtarve; at leaſt we had been debarred thoſe Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, without which the War could not have been carried on: This Deſign of the <hi>French</hi> was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the King, and therefore he was the more
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99346:31"/> earneſt in going forward: It was adviſed therefore in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Camp, That ſeeing we had a better Army by much in the Field than theirs (and might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beat them if they engaged), to march away, and ſo protract the time till they ſaw what became of the Deſign about burning our Ships, which they were confident would take effect. But the late King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was very much bent upon fighting, alledging, That if he retreated with his Army, and left <hi>Dublin</hi> and other places to the Enemy, the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who are ſoon diſheartned, and only judge according to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, would all deſert him by degrees; and then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and thoſe that ſtood by him, would be delivered up to the Mercy of the Enemy: So that ſeeing him in this humour, they were in hopes that a vigorous fit of Valour had ſeized him, and that he would next day play the Hero, in either Conquering Valiantly, or Dying Gloriouſly; and then having ordered the diſpoſing of their Army, they concluded to ſtay and watch our motion.</p>

               <p>On the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſide were killed my Lord <hi>Dungan,</hi> my <note place="margin">The number of the Dead.</note> Lord <hi>Carlingford,</hi> Sir <hi>Neal O Neal,</hi> with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other Officers, and about Thirteen or Fourteen hundred Soldiers; and we loſt on our ſide nigh Four hundred; but the loſs of Duke <hi>Schonberg,</hi> who was killed ſoon after the firſt of our Forces paſſed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, near the little Village called <hi>Old-Bridge,</hi> was much more conſiderable than all that fell that day on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99346:33"/> both ſides; whom his very Enemies always called a Brave Man, and a Great General; whoſe Name will make a conſiderable Figure in Hiſtory, whilſt there are ſuch places as <hi>Germany, Flanders, France, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Callimot,</hi> a brave and worthy Gentleman, died ſoon after him, of his Wounds, having followed that great man in moſt of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; whoſe elder Brother the Marqueſs <hi>Ruvigny</hi> had Duke <hi>Schonberg</hi>'s Regiment of <hi>French</hi> Horſe beſtowed upon him by the King. For the further Particulars of this Battel, and what hapned during the preceding Campaign, and alſo the moſt material Circumſtances of this, I refer the Reader to the Firſt Part of this Hiſtory, already printed.</p>
               <p>Some will pretend to ſay, That his Majeſty was a little too ſoon in the paſſing his Foot over the River, for the Left Wing of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army ſeemed reſolved to fight <hi>Douglaſs;</hi> but when they heard how things went at <hi>Old-Bridge,</hi> they retreated immediately towards <hi>Duleek,</hi> and ſo marched off untouched: But there was a very good reaſon for what his Majeſty did in this caſe, for it was about a quarter paſt Ten when our Foot firſt entred the River; and if the King had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it an hour longer, then the Tide, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally comes up above <hi>Old-Bridge,</hi> would certainly have prevented our men from paſſing either there or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; ſo that the Right Wing of our Army had been expoſed to the hazard of fighting all theirs, and the reſt not able to come to their relief, till poſſibly it had been too late; and this may ſerve to anſwer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be objected in that caſe.</p>
               <p>The late King at the beginning of this Battel ſtood by an old Church near the Village called <hi>Dunore;</hi> but aſſoon as he ſaw his men give way, he made haſte to <hi>Duleek,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Dublin,</hi> whither
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99346:33"/> he got that Evening by Nine a Clock, and early next morning ſent for the Popiſh Lord-Mayor, with ſome other Officers of the City, and gave them a charge not to burn it; and then going towards <hi>Bray,</hi> ſcarce looked behind him afterwards till he got to <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and ſo on Ship-board for <hi>France,</hi> leaving his poor <hi>Teagues</hi> to fight it out, or do what they pleaſed for him: And what was more remarkable, finding ſome of the Frigats at <hi>Waterford</hi> that were to go upon the Project of Burning our Ships, he told them all was loſt, and that it was paſt time, and ſo took them along with him; which prevented any further At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts upon our Ships. Whilſt his preſent Majeſty King <hi>William</hi> gave his Army other kind of Proofs both of his Courage and Conduct, having a Soul far above Fear, or any thing that may look mean in ſo Great a Prince: Nor ever had an Army a more entire Affection for their chief Commander, than his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's for him; his Reſolution being always undaunted, and their only Fear being for his Majeſty's Perſon. And whatever difference happens hereafter between his Majeſty and his Army, can only be this, That they deſire to ſtand between his Perſon and all Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but he always has a mind to put himſelf between them and it. May we long therefore have ſuch a General in a King; and he not only Soldiers but Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects too of all other Profeſſions, that honour him to that degree.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces that were engaged, and had opportunity to ſhew themſelves, gave ſignal demonſtrations of their Courage and Bravery; the <hi>Inniskilliners,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> too, both Horſe and Foot, did good ſervice; and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards deſerve no ſmall Honour for their Conduct that day.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:99346:34"/>
               <p> After the Battel, our Army lay upon their Arms all night at <hi>Duleek,</hi> having left our Tents all ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond the <hi>Boyne:</hi> And next morning his Majeſty ſent Brigadier <hi>La Mellionere,</hi> with One thouſand Horſe and Dragoons, a Party of Foot, and Eight Pieces of Cannon, to ſummons <hi>Drogheda,</hi> wherein the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had a Gariſon of about 1300 men, commanded by my Lord <hi>Iveagh,</hi> who ſurrendred the Town, upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That his <hi>Gariſon</hi> ſhould have leave to march out without their Arms, and be conducted to <hi>Athlone:</hi> Tho their Barbarity in tying the Proteſtants in Town back to back, and placing them where they expected our Guns to play, ought not to be forgot. This is a Town of no great ſtrength, only a Mount whereon are planted Ten Guns on the <hi>South-ſide</hi> the River, ſeems capable of Defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> his Majeſty had an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had left <hi>Dublin,</hi> and were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what haſte they could towards the <hi>Shannon;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> marched to that City, with One thouſand Horſe, and found Captain <hi>Farlow</hi> Governor of the Caſtle, who two days before had been a Priſoner; his Grace took poſſeſſion of all the Out-Guards of the Town with his Horſe, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Blue Guards were ſent to the Caſtle.

For though His Majeſty was ſenſible, that going with his whole Army towards <hi>Athlone,</hi> and ſo into <hi>Connaght,</hi> was the readieſt way to reduce the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> yet having ſome Reaſons to apprehend that the <hi>French,</hi> after the Battel of <hi>Flerus,</hi> might ſend off Detachments from their Army, and ſo diſturb <hi>England;</hi> or at leaſt ſend part of their Fleet, and burn his Tranſport-Ships, he made haſt to ſecure <hi>Waterford</hi> Haven for them, ſince the Bay of <hi>Dublin</hi> is no Place of ſafety.

This occaſioned ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the above-named Gentlemen, who had been imployed to make a repreſentation of their Caſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to the Lords Juſtices, which I have ſeen, and it was to this effect: <q>That amongſt a great many Diſcouragements in ſo troubleſome an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, their Commiſſion it ſelf was ſo defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99346:38"/> that it ſeemed a perfect Snare to them (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the intent or Intereſt of His Majeſty) in that it gave them power to ſeize upon all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures, but not to diſpoſe of any (except of Lands by leaſe for a year) by which means, the Goods ſeized by the Commiſſioners, and their Deputies, were often either ſtole, or forced away, ſometimes by the Army, and at other times by the Rapparees, after they had been at great charge about them.</q> And a great many other things they have to ſay for themſelves, by which it appears, that thoſe Aſperſions caſt upon ſome of them were groundleſs though others of them, or where-ever the fault elſe laid; ſome, I ſay, there were who did Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Affairs no great Advantage, nor themſelves much Credit by their management.

When <hi>Waterford</hi> was ſurrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, His Majeſty in Perſon went to view it; where he admitted my Lord <hi>Dover</hi> to a more particular Protection than ordinary, becauſe he had applied himſelf formerly by a Letter to Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi> to deſire a Paſs for himſelf, and Family, to go into <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majeſty, at his return to the Camp, declared <note place="margin">The King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>ON the ſixth of <hi>September</hi> our Army marched to <hi>Tipperary,</hi> about fourteen Miles from <hi>Limerick,</hi> where they begun to diſperſe towards their reſpective Quarters. And we had an Account by ſome Deſerters, that my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and all the <hi>French</hi> Forces were Ship'd off at <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> leave <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Gallway</hi> for <hi>France.</hi> The reaſon of this was alſo enquired after by a great many; that the <hi>French</hi> ſhou'd abſolutely quit <hi>Ireland,</hi> at a time when we had raiſed our Siege, which might have given them hopes of re-gaining the next Year what they loſt this; at leaſt, to defend the Province of <hi>Connaught</hi> againſt us, and ſo protract the War beyond what they cou'd have hoped for if the Town had been taken; and that if the want of Proviſions was an Objection, it was eaſier to carry thoſe to the Men than bring the Men to their Proviſions. But the reaſon that I have heard given for their departure was, That the late
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99346:43"/> King appearing very unexpectedly in <hi>France,</hi> at a time when all People were over-joyed with the News of the Battel of <hi>Flerus</hi> won at Land, and a Victory alſo gained at Sea; to palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate matters therefore as to himſelf, he laid all the blame upon the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that they wou'd not fight, but many of them laid down their Arms in ſuch order, as if they had been Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; which indeed ſome of them did: Upon which, the <hi>Fr.</hi> K. concluding that all was loſt in that Kingdom, he ſent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Count <hi>Lauzun</hi> to make the beſt of a bad Market, and ſo come off for <hi>France</hi> as well as he could, with all his Men. But the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> taking heart of grace at our Fleets and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Armies misfortunes, they held out beyond expectation: And thoſe Orders of the <hi>French</hi> Kings, not coming till after His Majeſty had raiſed the Siege of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi> Count <hi>Lauzun</hi> waited about twelve Days for a Countermand; but that not appearing he ſet ſail for <hi>France,</hi> tho' he met with contrary Orders at Sea; but then it was too late: For His Majeſty had been a Fortnight at <hi>London</hi> before they heard at <hi>Paris</hi> that the Siege of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick</hi> was raiſed; which ſhewed, that whatever good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence they might have from <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> at other times, they wanted it now; but whether the Wind was croſs, or what elſe was the reaſon, I am uncertain.</p>
               <p>About the fourteenth we heard that <hi>Sarsfield,</hi> with a part of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, had marched over the <hi>Shannon</hi> at <hi>Banoher-Bridge,</hi> and beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>Birr,</hi> wherein <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Birr</hi> beſieged by the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
                  </note> was only a Company of Colonel <hi>Tiffin</hi>'s Foot, who ſtoutly defended the Caſtle, the only temble place; but Major-General <hi>Kirk</hi> marching thither with a part of our Army, the Enemy quitted the Siege and marched off.</p>
               <p>At this time Count <hi>Solms,</hi> who commanded in Chief, was at <hi>Caſhel,</hi> where he received a Letter by a Trumpeter from the Duke of <hi>Berwick,</hi> then at <hi>Limerick,</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they heard of a Deſign of ours, to ſend all thoſe Priſoners, we had taken at ſeveral places, to be Slaves in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99346:43"/> the Foreign Plantations; and withal, threatning ours with the <hi>French</hi> Gallies. But this was only a trick of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers themſelves, to prevent their Soldiers from deſerting, making them believe there was a Contract to ſell them all to Monſieur <hi>Perara</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> for ſo much Bread, (which made the name of the <hi>Jew</hi> very terrible to the <hi>Iriſh.)</hi> But this was a mere Story of their own framing; and therefore Count <hi>Solms</hi> ſent the following Anſwer to the Duke's Letter.</p>

               <p>But though the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in and about <hi>Limerick,</hi> and indeed in moſt other places within their Line, were reduced to great neceſſities, both as to Proviſions and Cloaths; yet this did not prevent them from having a very good opinion of themſelves, nor blunt the Edge of that Vain-glorious Boaſting, ſo peculiar to that ſort of People, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by a pretended Declaration of the then Brigadeer <hi>Dorington</hi>'s, <q>who after ſeveral invective Expreſſions againſt his Majeſty and the Engliſh Government, and Wheedling Inſinuations to all Foreigners and others, who he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends were drawn in at unawares, he promiſes to protect, and receive into Pay all Officers or Souldiers that would forſake their Majeſties Service, and advance them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Merit; or thoſe that had no mind to ſerve, ſhould be Tranſported into <hi>France,</hi> having all neceſſary Accommodation, and be provided for in the mean time.

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But this worthy Declaration had no other effect than to ſhew the folly and vanity of the Publiſher; only I cannot but obſerve what a ſcurvy Return thoſe Officers and Souldiers of King <hi>William</hi>'s, to whom he addreſſes himſelf, made him for his kind proffer; ſince inſtead of going to him for his Paſs into <hi>France,</hi> they ſoon after ſent his Worſhip himſelf Priſoner into <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>The Rapparees by this time were got to the end of the <note place="margin">Rapparees in the Bogg of <hi>Allen.</hi>
                  </note> Bogg of <hi>Allen,</hi> within 12 miles of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and there Robb'd and Plunder'd the Country all about, Fortifying an Iſland in the Bogg to ſecure their Prey, which being
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99346:48"/> ſo nigh <hi>Dublin,</hi> it made a great noiſe: So that Collonel <hi>Foulks</hi> with his own Regiment, part of Collonel <hi>Cutts</hi>'s, and a Detachment of the <hi>Dublin</hi> Militia, as alſo three ſmall Field-Pieces, Marched out towards them: The <hi>Iriſh</hi> at firſt ſeemed to defend the place; but as our Men advanced, they quitted their Poſts, leaving us to fill up the Trenches they had made croſs the Cauſeway; which done, Colonel <hi>Foulks</hi> Marched over into the Iſland of <hi>Allen,</hi> where he met with Colonel <hi>Piper,</hi> who had come in at the other ſide; but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> betook themſelves to the Woods, and we only got ſome ſmall Booty which they had left.</p>
               <p>I have heard, that my Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> at his coming over from <hi>Ireland</hi> in King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt's time, to give his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty an account of the State of that Kingdom, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therthings, told the King, <hi>That the Iriſh were a wicked People, but had been as wickedly dealt withal.</hi> I make no Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Expreſſion to our ſelves, tho' moſt people that have been in that Country know how to do it.</p>
               <p>But as to any publick Action, little of moment hapned, for ſome time after we returned to our Winter Quarters, tho' the Rapparees, being encouraged by our withdrawing, were very troubleſome all the Country over: nor will it be amiſs, once for all, to give you a brief Account how the <hi>Iriſh</hi> managed this Affair, to make the Rapparees ſo Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable as they really were; doing much more miſchief at this <note place="margin">Upon what account the Rapparees were ſervica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
                  </note> time o'th' year, than any thing that had the face of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my could pretend to. When the <hi>Iriſh</hi> underſtood there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how our Men were Poſted all along the Line, and what advantage might be hoped for at ſuch and ſuch places, they not only encouraged all the protected <hi>Iriſh</hi> to do us ſecretly all the miſchief they could, either by concealed Arms, or private Intelligence, under the pretence of their being Plundered and abuſed; but they let looſe a great part of their Army to manage the beſt for themſelves, that time and opportunity would allow them: to all theſe they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99346:49"/> gave <hi>Paſſes,</hi> ſignifying to what Regiment they belonged, that in caſe they were taken, they might not be dealt withal as <hi>Rapparees,</hi> but Souldiers. Theſe Men knew the Country, nay, all the ſecret Corners, Woods and Boggs; keeping a conſtant Correſpondence with one another, and alſo with the Army, who furniſhed them with all neceſſaries, eſpecially Ammunition: When they had any Project on Foot, their method was not to appear in a Body, for then they would have been diſcovered; and not only ſo, but Carriages and ſeveral other things had been wanting, which every one knows that's acquainted with this Trade: Their way was therefore, to make a private appointment to meet at ſuch a Paſs or Wood, preciſely at ſuch a time o'th' night or day as it ſtood with their conveniency; and tho' you could not ſee a Man over night, yet exactly at their hour, you might find three or four hundred, more or leſs, as they had occaſion, all well Armed, and ready for what deſign they had formerly projected; but if they hapned to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, or over-powered, they preſently diſperſed, having before-hand appointed another place of Rendezous, ten or twelve miles (it may be) from the place they then were at; by which means our Men could never fix any cloſe Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them during the Winter; ſo that if they could have held out another year, the <hi>Rapparees</hi> would have continued ſtill very prejudicial to our Army, as well by killing our Men privately, as ſtealing our Horſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepting our Proviſions. But after all, leaſt the next Age may not be of the ſame humour with this, and the name of a <hi>Rapparees</hi> may poſſibly be thought a finer thing than it really is, I do aſſure you, that in my Stile they never can be reputed other than Tories, Robbers, Thieves, and Bogg-trotters.</p>
               <p>The Inſolence of thoſe People however, in the Bogg of <hi>Allen,</hi> was curbed by Colonel <hi>Foulks</hi> and Colonel Piper, before their return, who killed one <hi>Gibney</hi> a Captain, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99346:49"/> ſeveral others: About which time, the King diſpoſed of all <note place="margin">

               <p>A Party of three hundred Horſe and Dragoons, with two hundred of the Militia, went from <hi>Cork</hi> to relieve the Garriſon of <hi>Ballynagooly;</hi> after which they went to view <hi>Bally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Clough,</hi> in the Enemies poſſeſſion, but upon our approach, they drew into their Works, ſo that our Men killed only five, and took as many Priſoners.

               <p>About this time the Gentlemen of the County of <hi>Eaſt-Meath,</hi> meeting at <hi>Trim,</hi> agreed to ſcoure the <hi>Red</hi> Bog nigh that place, where the <hi>Rapparees</hi> haunted and had done much miſchief during the laſt Winter; the iſſue was, that thirty five were kill'd, and ſix more

               <p>This Month now draws towards an end, and all People that had any buſineſs towards the Camp, are reſorting thither; in order to which the Lords-Juſtices ſet out a Proclamation, <hi>Commanding all Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and others to carry no Ale, or other Liquors to the Camp, but what was good and well brewed, and to be at least ſix Days old; to prevent Fluxes and other Diſtempers.</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99346:66"/> they were in, to prevent the burning of it, he goes with all ſpeed with a Party of thirty Men from <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante</hi> towards <hi>Camgart,</hi> being not above an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile; but the Enemy were got in long before, and had ſecured all the Garriſon, and ſeeing our Party ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach they kept themſelves very cloſe within the Works.

But before I give you an Account of the taking this Fort, it will not be amiſs to give you a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Deſcription of it.</p>
               <p>I do not find any thing Remarkable of this place <note place="margin">The Place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</note> in former times; it's only a ſmall Village upon the Great Road between <hi>Mullingar</hi> and <hi>Athlone,</hi> being ten Miles diſtant from each. The place has always been very poor, and had only two or three Houſes of Entertainment in it, the reſt being all <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, to the number of a hundred or thereabouts, (though now there is neither Houſe nor Cabbin ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.) A little to the right of the Town as you go to <hi>Athlone,</hi> ſtood a pretty Church upon a riſing ground; about a hundred and twenty Yards from which there lies a ſpot of Ground about ſix Acres, which is almoſt an Iſland, by reaſon of a great Lough to the Eaſt, North, and North-Eaſt; and on the North-Weſt there is Bogg; a ſmall neck of Land running from the Church on the South-Weſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99346:68"/> it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from being altogether an Iſland. This Iſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus had been formerly Fortified with a double Ditch, and within that a Stone Wall, and then there ſtood a pretty ſtrong Houſe, where one Widow <hi>White</hi> lived the year before, when Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Douglas</hi> march'd that way to <hi>Athlone,</hi> who took Protection, and ſecured a good ſtock of Sheep and Cows in this Peninſula whilſt we lay Encamp'd by the Town. At the further end next the broadeſt part of the Lough, ſtood a ſtrong <hi>Daniſh</hi> Fort (as this Kingdom is every where full of them) now For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with a Ditch twenty Foot broad and ten Foot deep, being alſo Palliſado'd round. Towards the Eaſt and North-Eaſt, the Lough is ſo broad, that Cannon can do no execution over it; but towards the South-Eaſt, there is a large round Hill which overlooks the Iſland, and from whence you may ſee into all places of it. This place was neglected by us laſt year, as being ſo poor in it ſelf, that it could not ſupport a Garriſon; but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſeeing the natural ſtrength of it, and withal the advantage of diſturbing our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Garriſons from thence, they preſently fell to work and Fortified it; here they kept a Garriſon all Winter, and towards the Spring ſent that Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thither which we now found.</p>

               <p> But nothing leſs than marching out with Bag and Baggage, Drums beating, Colours flying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would ſatisfie this Noble Governour: Upon which, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ordered all our Guns and Mortars to fall to work, the Bombs tearing up the Sandy Banks, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning like Conies from one Hole to another; whilſt the Guns were battering the Works and making a Breach, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in the mean time did what they could with their two Guns and ſmall Shot; but Lieutenant-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Burton</hi> their Ingineer, had his Hand ſhot off from one of our Batteries, and their Works went down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, which made the <hi>Iriſh</hi> very uneaſie. This Siege however, was very delightful to our whole Army, who had a view of it from the adjoyning Hill. My Lord Juſtice <hi>Coningesby</hi> alſo, who was now in the Camp, and ſtay'd here for ſome time, having the ſatisfaction of being an Eye-witneſs of the forwardneſs of our Soldiers.</p>
               <p>About twelve a Clock the Enemy beat a Parley, and <note place="margin">A Parley beat.</note> hung out a white Flag, but the General would not take notice of it; and our Batteries went on with that ſucceſs, that two Breaches were made, one in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt Fort next the Town, the other on the Works on the ſame ſide within the Iſland; and the General ſeem'd reſolved to Storm the Fort next morning at the coming up of the Tin Boats: there were four large Boats however then in the Camp, which were the Fleet prepared laſt Year for <hi>Hoard</hi>'s Expedition upon the <hi>Shannon,</hi> and were all Winter at <hi>Mullingar.</hi> Theſe the General ordered to be Launched upon the Lough, and filled with Armed Men. The Enemy ſeeing this, and their Iſland being altogether open on that ſide, they were moſt terrible affraid of being all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: So that about ſeven a Clock they began to beat a Parley again, and hung out their Flag, begging
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99346:70"/> Quarter for God's ſake: which the General hearing and being in his own temper a very Merciful Man, he was pleaſed to order the Guns and Mortars to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear firing; and by eight of the Clock, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and ſome of the Officers coming out, they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred <note place="margin">The Fort ſurrendred.</note> the Place at diſcretion: Upon which Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Earl,</hi> with eight hundred Fire-Locks, march'd in over the Breach that our Guns had made; and the Enemy, laying down their Arms, were continued Priſoners in the Fort all Night.</p>

Our Men found alſo in the Fort four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty Sheep, about forty Cows, and fifty Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, and good ſtore of Oat-meal. We loſt in this Action only eight Men; and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had about forty kill'd by our Bombs and Cannon. But it ſeemed very inaccountable to moſt People, that the Enemy neither endeavoured to relieve or quit this place, ſince they loſt in it above a Regiment of their beſt Men; tho' this was but what they did afterwards at ſeveral places nigh <hi>Limerick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 10th. In the Morning early two hundred Men <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ballymore</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortified.</note> were drawn out to work at the Fort, which the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had ordered to be better fortified by a Line of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99346:71"/> from the Out-works to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Fort, and other additions towards the Water-ſide; our Men fell to work at firſt in repairing the Breaches, but were obliged to deſiſt by bad Weather; however they le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled all the Batteries and Trenches that we had made againſt the Fort. And Orders were given out that Night for one hundred Men of a Regiment to be for the Works in the Morning, with a Captain, Lieutenant, and Enſign. The Sutlers that were ready to go to <hi>Mullingar</hi> were to have a Guard at the Hoſpital, where they were to take up what Men were ſick or wounded: And the Majors of each Regiment were to have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Care that the Mens Arms were fix'd and clean; which Orders were often repeated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the 11th. One Captain <hi>Taylor</hi> and two private Men deſert from the Enemy, who acquaint us, that my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> by a Declaration, dated <hi>May</hi> the 15th. had ordered all the <hi>Rapparees</hi> into <hi>Connaught,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit their Army; and that the General, <hi>St. Ruth,</hi> at his going towards <hi>Athlone,</hi> had ordered Brigadier <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s Men to drive all the Cattle in thoſe parts in the Rear of the Army, for their ſupport; and that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> talk'd of giving us Battel; tho' they were generally diſſatisfied with the few and mean Cloaths ſent them out of <hi>France,</hi> and the ſmall allowances of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Evening it was given out in Orders, that the Chaplains ſhould ſay Prayers at the Heads of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Regiments at ten in the Morning and ſeven at Night, and to admoniſh the Men from Swearing; a Vice too common at all times amongſt us.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:99346:71"/>
               <p> The 12th. the Soldiers were prohibited Gaming; and all Guards were to be relieved conſtantly at nine a Clock. Our Line of Communication was then fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and we were working upon a Spur, Half-Moon, and Horn-Work, with a good Ditch to cover the Draw-Bridge and Entrance to the Out-work. There was alſo a Baſtion begun to the Right, towards the <hi>Lough,</hi> and a large Half-Moon towards the Left, both which command the new uttermoſt Work; and the Fort was ordered to be amended by throwing part of it down, and building it a new. A Work was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deſigned along the Lough-ſide to cover thoſe within, that ſide being open, and none could ſtir in the Fort but were expoſed to Shot from the Hill. A Platform was alſo deſigned for eight Guns on the top of the Mount.</p>
               <p>The ſame Day ten Guns and three Mortars, left at <hi>Mullingar,</hi> were brought up; and four Troopers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Enemy, who confirm the Report of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Athlone</hi> with the greateſt part of their Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the 13th. One hundred Priſoners were ſent from the Camp to <hi>Carne-Caſtle,</hi> (a place three Miles hence, where the <hi>Rapparees</hi> uſed to ſhelter themſelves) and demoliſhed it. And ſtealing being become ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common in the Camp, a Fellow was hanged for ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling an Horſe; which wrought ſome Reformation for a time.</p>
               <p>The 14th. and 15th. we continued improving the forementioned Works. On the 16th. a ſtrong Party of Horſe was ſent to view <hi>Athlone.</hi> And on the 17th. Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Toby Purcell</hi> was left Governor of <hi>Ballymore,</hi> with four Companies of Lieutenant-General
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99346:72"/> 
                  <hi>Douglas</hi>'s Regiment, who went himſelf towards the North, and from thence to <hi>Flanders.</hi> The ſame Day my Lord <hi>Lisburn</hi> was ſent out towards <hi>Lanesborough</hi> with a Party of two thouſand Foot and five hundred Horſe, who, meeting with a ſmall Party of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe, kill'd two or three, and the reſt fled in haſte towards the <hi>Shannon,</hi> but miſtaking the Ford one or two more were drown'd. That Evening Orders were given out, That no Sutler or other Perſon whatever ſhould buy any Ammunition, Arms, or Accoutrements, or any thing that belongs to the Soldiers, on pain of Death; becauſe the Soldiers, for a little Money, would be apt to ſell their Cloaths or Shooes. And, if as great Care were not taken of moſt of them as of Children, they would ſoon be in a very indifferent condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the 18th. The Army march'd from <hi>Ballymore,</hi>

               <p>The General with a Party of Horſe views <hi>Athlone,</hi> where he could ſee ſeveral of the Enemy's Horſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the little Hills nigh the Town, and their Camp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Miles beyond the River upon a narrow Neck of Land between two Boggs, where they remain'd till the Town was taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the 19th. Very early in the Morning our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance-Party <note place="margin">We approach the Town.</note> march'd, and by nine a Clock had beat the Enemy from ſeveral out Ditches to within the Walls of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Town on this ſide the River, our Men
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99346:72"/> lodging themſelves in the ſame Ditches. For tho' the <hi>Iriſh</hi> quitted it the Year before, and burnt the Houſes both without and within the Walls upon the approach of Lieutenant-General <hi>Douglas,</hi> yet they deſigned to ſhow more Courage this time, and defend this ſide the River alſo; which made ſome blame Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Douglas,</hi> as guilty of an Over-ſight, in not demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the Walls when he quitted it the Year preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but thoſe that accompanied him in that Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion know that he had not time for it. And ſince the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſeem'd ſo Brave, the General was reſolved to loſe no time, ordering three Guns to be planted nigh a Ford on <hi>Lanesborough-ſide,</hi> which play'd all that Day upon a Breaſt-Work that the Enemy had on the other ſide. About ſix in the Evening our Guns came up to a Battery planted between <hi>Isker</hi> and <hi>Athlone;</hi> and that Night we were hard at work in raiſing another Battery, on which we mounted nine eighteen Poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the 20th. about eight a Clock in the Morning <note place="margin">Batteries planted.</note> our Battery began to play on a Baſtion not far from <hi>Dublin-Gate;</hi> by twelve we made a Breach the breadth of the Baſtion, and continued firing to prevent the Enemy from raiſing any Works within. About three a Clock a Council of War was held, wherein the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Rules were agreed upon, in order to the ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Place at five.

In the Afternoon a <hi>French</hi> Lieutenant-Colonel was brought off by our Men, who had laid under the Bridge ſince the Attack; he was ſore bruiſed, and his Back almoſt broke, but ſeemed not to be ſo much afflicted with his own private Misfortune, as in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged with a People who were like to prove but very indifferent defenders of his Maſter the <hi>French</hi> King's Intereſt in that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The 23d. our Guns and Mortars continued firing all Night with that ſucceſs, that by five in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the whole ſide of the Caſtle was beaten down, and our Bombs had that effect upon it, as to make it very unſerviceable to the Enemy, who were now forced to make an Hole on the Weſt-ſide of the Wall to get out and in, though in a day or two they had no buſineſs there at all. About two that <note place="margin">The Tin Boats come up.</note> Afternoon our Tin Boats, Floats, and other Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, came to the Camp, with Colonel <hi>Byerley</hi>'s and my Lord of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Regiments, and a great many People were ſet to work to repair thoſe Boats that were ſpoiled the Year before nigh <hi>Limerick;</hi> for there being more New ones expected from <hi>England</hi> than really came, and what we had being judged too few, thoſe Old Boats were brought out of a place where they had been thrown by, and ſo were fitted up to lay next the Shore; which occaſion'd a Report, that they were concealed on purpoſe by the Store-keeper; but the thing was as it is here related.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99346:75"/> The ſame Afternoon a Priſoner was taken nigh the Bridge, who gave an Account, that Sixty-four Men were in a Mill upon the Bridge, which being fired by our Granades, and thoſe within not being able to quench it, nor get thence, they were all conſumed with the Fire, except the Priſoner and one more that eſcaped by leaping into the Water. A Drummer comes to the General from the Town, with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of his Letter, ſent the Day before, about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Priſoners.</p>
               <p>The 24th. was ſpent in raiſing three Batteries, one below the Bridge, another above it, and a third with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Town-Wall by the River-ſide, oppoſite to a Baſtion the Enemy had made on the other ſide the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. That Evening one of my Lord <hi>Lisburn</hi>'s Men going under the Bridge to ſee for Plunder, found a pair of Colours amongſt the dead Men; and tho' the Enemy fired a great many Shot at him, yet he brought them off flying, and preſented them to the General, who rewarded the Soldier with five Guinnea's.</p>
               <p>We begin now to contrive Methods of paſſing the River, and a Lieutenant of Horſe was commanded with a Party to a Ford towards <hi>Lanesborough,</hi> where the General was informed there might be an eaſie and undiſcovered Paſſage for moſt of our Army, whilſt our Cannon amuſed the Enemy at the Town. This Party went and found the Paſs according to Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but tho' he was poſitively ordered to return as ſoon as he had paſſed the River, yet ſuch are the powerful Charms of Black Cattle, to ſome ſorts of People, that the Lieutenant eſpying a Prey ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from him on the other ſide, muſt needs be ſcam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering after them; by which means our Deſign was
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99346:75"/> diſcovered, and the Enemy immediately provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, by throwing up ſtrong Works on the other ſide: The Lieutenant, I beard, was afterwards try'd, and ſuffered for it.</p>
               <p>That Night the Enemy raiſed two Batteries above <note place="margin">The Enemy plant new Batteries.</note> the Caſtle, the one cloſe by the River, the other at a greater diſtance from it upon a riſing Ground; the one of four, the other of three ſix Pounders; with the latter of which, <hi>June</hi> 25. they play'd on the old Walls in the Town, where our Men were lodged, but did lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no harm; with the other they ſhot into ſome of our Regiments, encamped near the River, which obliged them to remove to a greater diſtance. Our Battery of ſix Twenty-four Pounders below the Bridge, play'd on the Enemy's Breaſt-Work on the other ſide, which did it very great Damage, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ruin'd moſt of the Houſes that were as yet left ſtanding; which ſo expoſed the Enemies other Works to our view, that they were forced to quit moſt of their Trenches, none appearing but ſome few behind the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>The 26th. was ſpent in firing from ſeven Batteries <note place="margin">Seven Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries now at work.</note> upon the Enemies Works, and a great many were kill'd in endeavouring to repair them. About thirty Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons loaden with Powder come to the Camp; and that Night we poſſeſs our ſelves of all the Bridge, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one Arch at the farther end on <hi>Connaught</hi> ſide, which was broken down, and we repair another bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Arch in our poſſeſſion; and all Night our Guns and Mortars play moſt furiouſly. For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of paſſing the River at the Ford being fruſtrate, the General and the other Great Officers reſolve to try what can be done in forcing our way through
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99346:76"/> 
                  <hi>Athlone</hi> it ſelf, and therefore we labour hard to gain the Bridge; but what we got here was Inch by Inch as it were, the Enemy ſticking very cloſe to it, though great Numbers of them were ſlain by our Guns: And this Service coſt us great ſtore of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</p>
               <p>The 27th. ſeven <hi>Rapparees</hi> were brought in, being taken at <hi>Ballynehewen;</hi> to which place the General or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Garriſon of a Lieutenant and twenty Men. That Afternoon one hundred Carrs came from <hi>Dublin</hi> to the Camp loaden with Cannon-Ball: And all that Day our Guns and Mortars fired without intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We raiſed alſo a Battery of five Guns in the Meadow below the Town, to ſtop the way the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had on that ſide of coming into the Town. And in the Evening our Men burn the Breaſt-Works the Enemy had on the other ſide the broken Arch with throwing their Granado's; for moſt of theſe being made of Faſcines, and the Weather being hot, they ſoon dried and eaſily took fire. That Night we wrought very hard on the laſt Arch in the Enemies poſſeſſion. So that on,</p>
               <p>Sunday the 28th. in the Morning our Beams were laid <note place="margin">The Enemy ruin our Works.</note> over and partly planked; which the Enemy perceiving, they detach'd a Sergeant and ten Men out of Brigadier <hi>Maxwell</hi>'s Regiment, being all bold and daring <hi>Scots,</hi> theſe were all in Armour, and came over their own Works with a deſign to ruin ours, but were all of them ſlain; and yet this did not diſcourage as many more from ſetting about the ſame piece of Service, and they effected it by throwing down our Planks and Beams, maugre all our Firing and Skill, tho' they all loſt their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99346:76"/> Lives as Teſtimonies of their Valour, except two who eſcaped amongſt all the Fire and Smoak: This made us reſolved to carry on our Work by a cloſe Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery on the Bridge; which was done. But all laſt Night and that Morning the Enemy were hard at work, in repairing ſome old, and making new Trenches in the Meadow oppoſite to our new Battery; and our Guns are now playing very briskly, eſpecially on a place called <hi>Connaught-Tower,</hi> which ſtood on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Caſtle, and was ſo ſolid, that it took up more time to bring down than any one part of the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>This Afternoon a Council of War was held, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">A deſign to paſs the <hi>Shan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</hi>
                  </note> it was concluded, That next Morning we ſhould attempt paſſing the <hi>Shannon;</hi> one Party to go over the Bridge; a ſecond to paſs upon the Floats and Pontoons; and a third Detachment were to go over the Ford below the Bridge; where our Horſe were alſo to paſs and ſecond the Foot; a large Breach being made on the other ſide for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. And accordingly at Night Orders were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, That forty three Granadeers, eighty three private Men, three Captains, five Lieutenants, two Enſigns, and ſeven Sergeants out of each Regiment, with fifteen Shots a Man, and every one a green Bough in his Hat, ſhould be ready by ſix a Clock in the Morning under the Walls of the Town, and all to be commanded by Major-General <hi>Mackay;</hi> but the whole to be done with the greateſt ſilence and ſecreſie imaginable. <hi>Killkenny</hi> was the Word that Night.</p>
               <p>The 29th. in the Morning our Men were ready according to Orders, and march'd to the Town-Wall, where they ſtood at their Arms; but before our
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99346:77"/> Boats and their Appurtenances could be drawn into the Town it was ten a Clock; and all this Morning we obſerved great Bodies of the Enemy march into the <hi>Iriſh Town</hi> (though our Cannon were very troubleſome to them) for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> gueſſing at our Deſign, or rather being aſſured of it by ſome Deſerters, they drew a very conſiderable Body of their choiceſt Men to their Works. But whilſt theſe Preparations were making on both ſides, the Granadiers of both Parties that defended the Breaſt-works on the Bridge, throwing <note place="margin">The Enemy burn our cloſe Gallery.</note> Hand-Granadoes one at the other; the Enemies Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes ſet fire to our Faſcines that lay cloſe on the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Arch where our Gallery was, which ſuddenly flamed ſo violently, that our Men could not endure the Fire and Smoke that blew in their faces; and though they laboured very hard to extinguiſh it, yet could not prevent the burning that part of the Breaſt-work next the broken Arch, but preſerved all the reſt, by raiſing another Breaſt-work on a ſudden juſt behind the burnt one. By this time it was paſt twelve a Clock, and the Generals finding the Attack upon the Town that way like to coſt many Lives, they deferr'd it till new Meaſures were Conſulted on; nor knew they well what to think at preſent, ſeeing themſelves defeated in ſo great a Project; and, as it fell out, Providence in all appearance had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it for the beſt; for it's probable, that if our Men had really forced the Bridge at that time, they would have run great hazards in ſtorming the Town, the Enemy being ſo well provided for them; and then our Retreat could not have been without the ruin of more Men than it has pleaſed God we loſt in all the Actions ſince. All that Afternoon our Guns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue firing. And alſo,</p>

                  <hi>June</hi> the 30. Our Canon play without ceaſing and in the Afternoon another Council of War was held, wherein the difficulties of ſtaying there any longer were repreſented, all the Forrage being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed <note place="margin">A Council of War.</note> for ſeveral Miles round, ſo that they muſt reſolve to do ſomething with Expedition, or elſe to remove with the whole Army to ſome more likely Paſs, which wanted not its inconveniencies neither, ſince by this means the Enemy were encouraged, and our own men diſheartened at the beginning of the Campaign, and not only ſo, but upon our removing there was a way open for the Enemy even to <hi>Dublin</hi> it ſelf, at leaſt into all the Countries adjacent, by which means we muſt expoſe at leaſt our Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to hazzard, and ſo be forced to go back to make a defenſive, inſtead of an offenſive War; And on the other hand to make an Attack upon the Town, not to ſucceed, and then be forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move wou'd be of more fatal Conſequence.</p>
               <p>However, the Duke of <hi>Wertenberg,</hi> the Major Generals, <hi>Mackey, Talmaſh, Ruvigny</hi> and <hi>Tetteau,</hi> urged that no brave Action could be attempted without hazzard, and conſidering the goodneſs of our own men, and the faintneſs of the Enemy in all great Attacks that had been made upon them, hitherto, they ſtood up for the probability of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, proffering themſelves to be the firſt that ſhou'd indeavour to force the Enemies Works in their own perſons, (particularly Major General <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſh,</hi> very forward and inſtrumental in promoting was of it,) which they happily performed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, for the Detachment drawn down the day before was ordered ſtill to be in a readineſs, and <note place="margin">A Party orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to paſs the River.</note> the General gave Command that they ſhould be all brought

Granadeers all in Armour, and 20 a Breaſt, ſeconded by another good Body, who all with an amazing reſolution took the River, the Stream being very Rapid and deep, at which time our Great and Small Shot began to play from our Batteries and Works on our ſide upon the Enemies Works on the other, and they fired as thick as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them upon our men that were paſſing the River, who forced their way thro Fire and Smoak, and gaining the other Bank, the reſt laid Planks over the broken part of the Bridge, and others were laying the Bridge of Boats, by which our men paſt over ſo faſt that in leſs than half an hour we were Maſters of the Town; and all the Trenches except one beyond the Town, for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being amazed at the ſuddenneſs of the thing, and the reſolution of our men, with no great difficulty began to give ground, and ſoon after made the beſt of their way towards their Camp, tho a great many of them were killed in their Works; and yet it's obſervable that our men when they ſaw themſelves really Maſters of the Town, were not at all forward to kill thoſe at their mercy, tho it was in a manner in the heat of Action, but the Rubbiſh and Stuff thrown down by our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non was more difficult to climb over than a great part of the Enemies Works, which occaſioned our Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to Swear and Curſe even amongſt the Bullets

               <p>THE firſt of <hi>July,</hi> My Lord <hi>Portland</hi>'s Regiment of Guards Landed at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and marcht in two or three Days towards the Camp; upon our taking the Town, Monſ. St. <hi>Ruth</hi> with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army <note place="margin">The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my decamp.</note> decamped that night, and marcht towards <hi>Milton</hi> Paſs; and next day about 10 a Clock their Reer Guard of Horſe ſtood on the other ſide of <hi>Melahy,</hi> their Foot vaniſhing out of ſight toward <hi>Balynaſloe:</hi> for Monſieur St. <hi>Ruth,</hi> being out-done in ſo conſiderable a matter as the loſing <hi>Athlone,</hi> he was reſolved to retrieve his loſs or Dye, ſince he could not be anſwerable to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that imployed him for what had already happened: and therefore he uſed all the means poſſible to ſtrengthen his Army &amp; find out a convenient place of advantage to try his Fortune in, ſince he ſaw that we were not ſhye in affording him opportunities; &amp; now he begins to be very kind to, and familiar with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers, whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he had treated with Diſreſpect and Contempt; and to Careſs the Soldiers, tho a little before, he would Hang a Dozen of them in a morning, for very ſlender faults, as they thought: he draws therefore his Army into the moſt convenient poſture he could, to watch our Motions.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing our General did after the Town was <note place="margin">The Dead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Athlone</hi> Buried.</note> taken, was to order the Dead in and about the Town to be buryed; and in the Evening all our Army was
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99346:82"/> drawn up, and 41 pieces of Cannon fared three rounds, being ſeconded by the Horſe and Foot, and then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bonfires for Joy that the Town was taken, which had coſt us 12000 Cannon Bullets, 600 Bombs, nigh 50 Tun of Powder, and a great many Tun of Stones ſhot out of our Mortars.</p>
               <p>But after the Town was taken, the Soldiers were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them unruly, and committed ſeveral outrages; therefore it was given out in Orders that night, that no Soldier ſhould go to the Town, or over the Water, on pain of Death: and the Sutlers that went to <hi>Dublin,</hi> were ordered to go to the Hoſpital, and take up the ſick and wounded Men. And here let me obſerve once for all, that we had much better conveniencies for our Sick and Wounded this Campaign than formerly, having a great many large Tents ſet up in form of a Quadrangle, with Quilts and other conveniencies for every Soldier: nor was Dr. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> Phyſitian to the Army; <hi>Charles Thomſon</hi> Eſquire, Chirurgeon General; Mr <hi>Thomas Proby,</hi> and the reſt of the Chirurgeons wanting in their careful induſtry to recover and heal the Sick and Wounded; which no doubt muſt be a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the poor Soldiers, when they know that if any misfortune attends them, they ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be taken care for. <note place="margin">The Enemy Reſolve to give us Battle.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> We had an account by ſome Deſerters, that the Enemies Foot were gone beyond <hi>Balynaſloe,</hi> and their Horſe were Encampt on this ſide of it; that they reſolved to ſtay thereabouts and Fight us, tho at preſent they were in a great Conſternation, and ſeem'd doubtful of their own performances. A great many of the Country people and Deſerters came hourly in, and the General gave them all protections, aſſuring them that they ſhou'd be kept Inviolable againſt any of our Army or others, reſolving to puniſh the Offenders with Death: but on the other hand expected all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99346:83"/> of dutiful Subjects to their Majeſties from them: and if any were found to carry Intelligence to the Enemy, or harbour, ſuccour or conceal them, they ſhould ſuffer Death for it. This day the General had an account from one Capt. <hi>Aughmouty,</hi> that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy had quitted <hi>Lanesbourgh,</hi> and that he with his Troop had poſſeſt himſelf thereof.</p>

That morning <hi>William Robinſon</hi> Eſquire, one of the Pay-maſters to the Army, came with Money, as alſo many Waggons and Carts, with Ammunition and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meceſſaries.

               <p>The Fourth proved very Rainy, yet our Men were imployed in clearing the Streets; repairing the Breaches, and mounting four of the Enemies Guns taken in the Town, upon ſome of our ſpare Carriages.

               <p>The General upon viewing the Poſture of the Enemy, and a Map given him of the Ground, he found it no eaſie matter to Attack them; but reſolved however to

                  <hi>Titus Livius</hi> before a Battle, frequently brings in the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals ſaying a great many fine things, and making long Speeches, which poſſibly they never dreamt of, tho moſt of them were well bredmen; and if they did make uſe of thoſe Speeches, that way of treating Armies is now quite out of Faſhion, eſpecially it's improbable it ſhould be done by a General, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as little <hi>Iriſh</hi> as moſt of his Army did <hi>French:</hi> Nor is it to be believed that Monſieur St. <hi>Ruth</hi> was a man of that Boaſting vain-glorious humour that this Speech makes him, tho I have heard from ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers ſince, that he told them they had gained the Character of Cowards both at home and abroad, and now was their time to retrieve it, and that they Fought for their Religion, King and Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However it was, all who ſaw the ſpot of Ground he had made Choice of, can but admire his Conduct in this particular: And no doubt his Army had all the Maſſes, Perſuaſions, and other incouragements that could be thought of; amongſt the reſt that powerful one of Brandy, which made a Dragoon of ours tell ſome of their Priſoners after the Battle, that they had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of us, both in Prayers and Brandy: The <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> being indeed too remiſs in point of Devotion, not looking up to that Power, to which we are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted, for all that we can pretend to that's Good.</p>
               <p>But to return to our own Army, <hi>Sunday</hi> July the <note place="margin">Our Army march in ſight of the Enemy.</note> 12. about Six in the Morning we marcht, the Foot over the Bridge; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Horſe at the Foord above, and the Dutch and <hi>Danes</hi> over two Foords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, with directions to put themſelves in order of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99346:89"/> when all paſt the River, which was done on a kind of uneven hilly Ground, and the method being agreed before, the two lines of Battle were thus, as in the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Plate are deſcribed.</p>
               <p>It's to be obſerved that My Lord <hi>Portland</hi>'s Horſe is not in this Line of Battle, becauſe they came not up till after it was ordered; hower they had their full ſhare in the Acton, and Col. <hi>Foulks</hi>'s Regiment was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to guard the Train, but being then convenient for it, and the General reſolving to make all the Force he could, they had alſo their part, both of the Honour and Service of the Action. And tho Brigadeer <hi>Stuart</hi> is there ſet down, it's only as to his Poſt, for he was then at <hi>Dublin</hi> ill of his Wounds received at <hi>Athlone.</hi> Col. <hi>Lloyds</hi> Regiment was alſo in Gariſon at <hi>Athlone,</hi> and two more left at <hi>Balynaſloe,</hi> ſo that we were not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo ſtrong as this Line of Battle makes us.</p>
               <p>In this order (the Morning proving Foggy) our Army ſtood till nigh 12 a Clock, and then were Commanded to Advance, the General going with a party before to view the Enemy, and perceiving ſome of their out Scouts upon the Hills, ordered a party to beat them thence, upon whoſe advance the Enemy retired from place to place, till they were within half a Mile of their Camp, by which means the General had an opportunity from an high Hill to the Right of the Enemy, to view their whole Army, poſted as before deſcribed: by which poſture, they had the advantage by at leaſt 1000 men, but being aſſured of the valour of his Army, the General reſolved to draw nearer, and expect what further opportunities of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage might offer, in order to which, and for the ſecurity of our own Army, he ſaw the neceſity of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Paſs to the Right of the Enemy, called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chree,</hi> where the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had ſome men poſted, he ſent therefore a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Captain with 16 Troopers to force it,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99346:89"/> but the men run away from a leſs number than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, tho the Officer behaved himſelf very well, and the reſt retrieved their Honour afterwards; upon this the General ordered two Hundred of Sir <hi>Albert Cunninghams</hi> Dragoons to march to certain Ditches, nigh the ſaid Foord, to keep the Enemy from coming over, and in the mean time our Army was marching forwards; by this time it was Two a Clock, and the General finding the neceſſity of having that Foord, and other ways that led to the Right of the Enemy, as the moſt proper ways to aſſault them, he ordered <hi>Cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Dragoons, at the Ditch, to advance towards a Party of the Enemy that ſtood on the other ſide, &amp; were ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a conſiderable Body, behind the Houſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rachree,</hi> all which, at the advancing of our Dragoons, retired behind an Hill nigher their Camp, and where a greater Body was poſted; then ſome of our Dragoons preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on too far were obliged to retreat a little diſorderly, the Enemy ſuſtaining their Men by ſeveral freſh Parties, which the General perceiving, he ordered Briggadeer <hi>Eppinger</hi>'s Dragoons to get between them and their Camp; but this was diſcovered by the Enemy, who had the advantage of pouring in ſo many Men upon us that they would have been too hard for our Dragoons ſtill, if they had not been quickly ſeconded by greateſt part of the Earl of <hi>Portlands</hi> Horſe, who behaved themſelves with great Bravery, and loſt ſeveral Men and Horſes in this part of the Action: And what was at firſt only a Skirmiſh, had by this time engaged a conſiderable Body on both ſides, freſh Parties being ſtill ſent out, tho after about an hours diſpute, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy were obliged to retire in ſome Diſorder, over the Brook, that flanked the Right of their Army, no conſiderable dammage being done as yet to either ſide.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:99346:90"/>
               <p> Then all things ſeemed pretty quiet for a while, and our General Officers coming together, began to conſult whither it was fit to give the Enemy Battel that Night, conſidering the diſadvantages we were to expect in Attacking them, ſome therefore were for defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Battle that Night, and ſo to fall on by break of day next Morning, which was ſo far agreed to as that our Tents were ordered to be ſent for, and pitched along the other ſide the Bogg; but then perceiving the Enemy to be in ſome Diſorder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by what had already happened, they concluded not to delay their Attack, leſt the Enemy ſhould March off in the Night, and ſo afford us no more opportunities; it was therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to proſecute the Battel on the Enemies Right, by that means propoſing to draw part of their ſtrength from <hi>Aghrim</hi> Caſtle, nigh which their main Body was poſted, that ſo our Right might have the eaſier Paſſage over to Attack their Left, and then our whole Army might have opportunity to engage. This (I am told) was the Advice of Major General <hi>Mackay;</hi> a Man of great Judgement, and long Experience, and it had its deſired Succeſs.</p>
               <p>Our Army was diſpoſed of as you ſee in the Line of Battel, only the General moved up and down as he ſaw occaſion, as did alſo the reſt of the General Officers; and before the Battel began, there was no diſtance left between the firſt and ſecond Line, ſince a great part of the ſecond Line were the firſt that engaged. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army was commanded by Monſieur St. <hi>Ruth,</hi> Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General <hi>D'uſſon,</hi> Monſieur <hi>De' Teſſec,</hi> Lieutenant General <hi>Sarſefield,</hi> Major General <hi>John Hambleton,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General <hi>Dorington,</hi> and ſeveral other.</p>
               <p>About half an hour paſt Four in the Afternoon, a part of our Left Wing moved towards the Enemy, and by Five the Battel began a freſh. A Party of our Foot
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99346:90"/> marched up to their Ditches, all ſtrongly guarded with Musketiers, and their Horſe poſted advantageouſly to ſuſtain them: here we fired one upon another for a conſiderable time, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> behaved themſelves like Men of another Nation, defending their Ditches ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for they would maintain one ſide, till our Men put their Pieces over at the other, and then having Lines of Communication, from one Ditch to another, they would preſently poſt themſelves again, and flank us; this occaſioned great firing on both ſides, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued on the Left nigh an hour and an half, e're the Right of our Army, or the Centre engaged, except with their Cannon, which played on both ſides. All this while our Men were coming up in as good Order as the Inconveniency of the Ground would allow, and now Major General <hi>Mackay,</hi> and the reſt, ſeeing the Enemy draw off ſeveral Bodies of Horſe and Foot from the Left, and move towards their Right, where our Men preſſed them very hard; they laid hold on that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and ordered the Foot to march over the Bogg, which fronted the Enemies main Battel. Colonel <hi>Earl,</hi> Colonel <hi>Herbert,</hi> Colonel <hi>Creighton,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Brewers</hi> Regiments went over at the narroweſt place where the Hedges on the Enemies ſide run furtheſt into the Bogg. Theſe four Regiments were ordered to march to the loweſt of the Ditches, adjoining to the ſide of the Bogg, and there to poſt themſelves till our Horſe could come about by <hi>Aghrim</hi> Caſtle, and ſuſtain them, and till the other Foot had marched over the Bogg below, where it was broader, and were ſuſtained by Col. <hi>Foulk</hi>'s, and Brigadeer <hi>Steuarts.</hi> Col. <hi>Earl</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with his Regiment, and the reſt after him, over the Bogg, and a Rivulet that ran through it, being moſt of them up to their Middles in Mudd and Water. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> at their near approach to the Ditches, ſired upon them, but our Men contemning all Diſadvantages, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99346:91"/> immediately to the loweſt Hedges, and beat the <hi>Iriſh</hi> from thence. The Enemy however did not retreat far, but poſted themſelves in the next Ditches before us: which our Men ſeeing, and diſdaining to ſuffer their Lodging ſo near us, they would needs beat them from thence alſo, and ſo from one Hedge to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, till they were got very nigh the Enemies main Battel. But the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had ſo ordered the matter, as to make an eaſie Paſſage for their Horſe, amongſt all thoſe Hedges and Ditches, by which means they poured in great numbers both of Horſe and Foot upon us: which Colonel <hi>Earl</hi> ſeeing, encouraged his Men, by advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing before them, and ſaying, <hi>There was no way to come off but to be Brave.</hi> As great an Example of true Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Generoſity as any Man this Day living. But being both flanked and fronted, as alſo expoſed to all the Enemies Shot from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Ditches; our Men were forced to quit their Ground, and betake themſelves to the Bogg again, <note place="margin">A Party of our Foot beat back.</note> whither they were followed, or rather drove down by main ſtrength of Horſe and Foot, and a great many killed. Colonel <hi>Earl,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Herbert,</hi> were here taken Priſoners; the former, after twice taking and retaking, got free at laſt, tho not without being wounded.</p>
               <p>Whilſt this was a doing here, Col. St. <hi>Johns,</hi> Col. <hi>Tiffin,</hi> Lord <hi>George Hambleton,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and ſeveral other Regiments, were marching over below upon the ſame Bogg. The <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in the mean time, laid ſo cloſe in their Ditches, that ſeveral were doubtful whether they had any Men at that place or not: but they were convinced of it at laſt; for no ſooner were the <hi>French,</hi> and the reſt, got within twenty yards, or leſs, of the Ditches, but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> fired moſt furiouſly upon them; which our Men as bravely ſuſtained, and preſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, tho they could ſcarce ſee one another for Smoak.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99346:91"/> And now the thing ſeemed ſo doubtful for ſome time, that the By-ſtanders would rather have given it on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſide; for they had driven our Foot in the Centre ſo far back, that they were got almoſt in a Line, with ſome of our Great Guns, planted near the Bogg, which we had not the Benefit of at that Juncture, becauſe of the mixture of our Men and theirs.</p>
               <p>M. G. <hi>Ruvigny</hi>'s <hi>French</hi> Horſe, and Sir <hi>John Laniers,</hi> being both poſted on the Right, were afterwards part of <note place="margin">Our Horſe paſs the Bogg, near the Caſtle of <hi>Aghrim.</hi>
                  </note> them drawn to the Left, where they did very good Service. And the Right Wing of our Horſe, in the mean time were making what haſte they could to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour our Foot; for ſeeing their Danger, and indeed that all was in hazard by reaſon of the Difficulty of the Paſs, they did more than Men, in preſſing and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling over a very dangerous place, and that amongſt Showrs of Bullets, from a Regiment of Dragoons, and two Regiments of Foot, poſted conveniently under Cover, by the Enemy, to obſtruct our Paſſage. Our Horſe, at this place, were ſuſtained by Major General <hi>Kirks,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Guſtavus Hambleton</hi>'s Foot, who, after we had received the Enemies Fire, for a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time, marched under the Walls of the Caſtle, and Lodged themſelves in a dry Ditch, in the throng of the Enemies Shot from the Caſtle, and ſome other old Walls, and Hedges, adjoining. Thoſe that have ſeen the place, and conſidered the Diſadvantages that our Men had at ſuch a Juncture to encounter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, muſt needs Acknowledge the Action very Brave. For its reported, that Monſieur St. <hi>Ruth,</hi> ſeeing our Horſe draw that way, and then begin to ſcramble over at a place where only two a Breaſt could paſs, and that too with great difficulty; after all which, they had no other way to march, but to go within thirty yards of the Caſtle. The <hi>French</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:99346:92"/> General ſeeing our Men attempt to do this, askt <hi>What they meant by it?</hi> And being anſwered, That they would certainly endeavour to paſs there, and Attack him on the Left; he is ſaid to reply with an Oath, <hi>They are brave Fellows, its a pity they ſhould be ſo expoſed,</hi> or Words to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Our Horſe, with much difficulty, made good that Paſs; Sir <hi>Francis Compton,</hi> with my Lord of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Regiment, being one of the firſt that could be in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to Engage, he fell at Random in amongſt the Enemy, and charged them briskly, with Sword in Hand: and tho his Men were once or twice Repulſed, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeconded with part of Major General <hi>Ruvigny</hi>'s Horſe, Colonel <hi>Langſton</hi>'s, and ſome of Colonel <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erley</hi>'s Horſe; as alſo Brigadeer <hi>Leveſon</hi>'s Dragoons, they ſoon made Good their Party on that ſide, tho' not without the loſs of ſeveral both Men and Horſes.</p>
               <p>The Major General <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> ſeeing the Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage <note place="margin">Major General <hi>Talmaſh</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours our Foot.</note> our Foot laboured under in the Centre, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at once an extream concern for his Countrymens being repulſed, and as much Generoſity and Courage, by haſtning to Succour thoſe that at that time ſtood moſt in need of it; coming up therefore in all haſte, with ſome freſh Men, he gave Orders for our broken Regiments to halt, and face about, which they did immediately, and returned the ſame Meaſure to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that ſome of themſelves had met withal, the very Minute before, that is, they knockt them on the Head; for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> followed us toward the Centre of the Bogg, which tho not two hundred yards from the loweſt Ditches, yet before the Enemy could recover thoſe again, our Men had killed above three hundred of them, and then marched boldly up to their old Ground again, from whence they had been lately beat: which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99346:92"/> is only natural to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men; for it's obſervable, that they are commonly fiercer, and bolder, after being repulſed than before; and what blunts the Courage of all other Nations, commonly whets theirs, I mean the killing of their Fellow Soldiers before their Faces.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, Major General <hi>Mackay</hi> had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon the Enemy with a good Body of Horſe on their Left, and then Major General <hi>Ruvigny</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſide of the Bogg, with another Party of Horſe, who did extraordinary Service, bearing down all before them: then the Horſe and Foot of our Right, and their Left mixing, there was nothing but a continued fire, and a very hot diſpute all along the Line. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> indeavouring to defend their Ditches, and our men as forward to beat them from thence. But the thing was doubtful not much longer, for Monſ. St. <hi>Ruth,</hi> when he firſt ſaw our Foot in the Centre repulſed, in a great Ecſtaſy, told thoſe next him, <hi>that he wou'd now beat our Army back to the Gates of</hi> Dublin. But ſeeing our Horſe preſs over towards the Caſtle, he ordered a Brigade of his own Horſe to march up; then Riding to one of his Batteries, and giving orders to the Gunner where to fire, he was march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the place where he ſaw us indeavour to come over, but was killed with a great Shot from one of our Batteries, as he rid down the Hill of <note place="margin">Monſiuer St. <hi>Ruth</hi> killed.</note> 
                  <hi>Killkomodon,</hi> the place where the main ſtreſs of the Battle was fought, being juſt under the Enemies Camp. When Monſieur St. <hi>Ruth</hi> fell, one of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue threw a Cloak upon his Corps, and ſoon after removed him beyond the Hill, his Guard going off at the ſame time, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe perceiving, a great many of them drew off alſo.</p>
               <p>I never could learn what became of his Corps, ſome ſay that he was left ſtript amongſt the other dead, when
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99346:93"/> our men purſued beyond the Hill; and others that he was thrown into a Bogg: However tho the man had an ill Character in being one of the greateſt Perſecutors of the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> yet, we muſt allow him to be very brave in his Perſon, and indeed conſiderable in his Conduct, ſince he brought the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to fight a better Battle, than ever their Nation could boaſt of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And this was the reaſon, as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> report, that the General being killed, tho it was not preſently known, yet their Army was ſoon in Confuſion for want of Orders, and ſo the Horſe forced to draw off. But the truth of it was, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> before they began to ſhrink, had behaved themſelves beyond all expectation, and had fought longer than ordinary; yet when they ſaw our Horſe come over ſo dangerous a Paſs, and our Foot in the Centre Rally, and reſolve to dye every man rather than be beat back again; the <hi>Iriſh</hi> then thought they muſt be beat if the other would not: ſo that notwithſtanding all their advantages of Hedges and Ground, Sun and Wind, they were forced to quit one advantagious Poſt, and after that another, till being beat from Ditch to Ditch, they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to the Top of the Hill of <hi>Killkomodon,</hi> where <note place="margin">The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Routed.</note> their Camp had laid, which being levelled, and they expoſed to our Shot more openly, they began now to run down right; the Foot towards a great Bogg behind them on their Left, and the Horſe on the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way towards <hi>Loughreagh.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> upon their advantage in the Centre of the Battle, had taken ſome Priſoners (as has been ſaid) but not being able to carry them off, they killed Col. <hi>Herbert</hi> and one or two more; which ſeveral have lookt upon as a piece of cruelty: and yet it's no more than what has been often practiſed in ſuch Caſes, and that to a greater degree; for at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Agincourt,</hi> Fought between <hi>Hen. 5th.</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>France</hi> upon the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1414. the number of the Priſoners taken by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> being very great, and King <hi>Henry</hi> after the Battle, perceiving freſh Troops of the King of <hi>Sicill</hi>'s to appear in the Field, and theſe ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough without any new rallyed Forces to Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his wearied Soldiers; that he might not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have both Priſoners to Guard, and an Enemy to fight at once, he commanded every man to kill his Priſoner, contrary to his Generous Nature; which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99346:95"/> was immediately done, ſome principal men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: and then upon his Meſſage to the Enemy either to Fight or immedately to quit the Field, they choſe the latter: And ſome ſay that My Lord <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> had hard meaſure from ſome of our Foreign Toopers, who kill'd him after he had ſurrendered himſelf a Priſoner; not to themſelves, but to ſome others.</p>
               <p>The place where this Battle was fought, will make a noiſe in Hiſtory for the future, tho there's nothing worth taking notice of near it: For that which they call the Caſtle of <hi>Aghrim</hi> is only an old ruinous Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with ſome Walls and Ditches about it, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has been a place of any Strength, only as it's ſeated upon a Paſs. There are about half a ſcore little Cabbins on the other ſide a ſmall Brook, with the Ruins of a little Church, and a Priory De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to St. <hi>Catherine,</hi> and founded by the <hi>Butlers;</hi> the whole being at this day the Eſtate of the D. of <hi>Ormond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After things went clear on our ſide, this old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aghrim</hi> Caſtle taken.</note> was taken, and a great many put the Sword in it. Col. <hi>Burk</hi> the Commander, his Major, Eleven Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers more, and Forty Soldiers were made Priſoners.</p>
               <p>In this Battle, we took from the Enemy nine pieces of Braſs Cannon, which they had planted at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places to their greateſt advantage; all their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, Tents and Baggage, with moſt of their ſmall Arms, which they threw away, to run the faſter; we took alſo Eleven Standards, and thirty two pair of Colours: The General rewarding every one that brought any in the next day, and ſent them afterwards by my Lord <hi>O Bryan,</hi> as a preſent to Her Majeſty. We killed ſeven Thouſand of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> upon <note place="margin">The number of the Dead.</note> the Spot, as was generally believed, and there could
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99346:95"/> not be many fewer, for looking amongſt the Dead three days after, when all our own and ſome of theirs were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, I reckoned in ſome ſmall Incloſures 150 in others 120, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lying moſt of them by the Ditches where they were Shot; and the reſt from the top of the Hill where their Camp had been, looked like a great Flock of Sheep, ſhattered up and down the Countrey, for almoſt four Miles round: And the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves, tho they will not allow ſo many to be killed, yet they own, that they loſt more, which they could never have any account of, except they ſtole home privately, or elſe turned Rapparees. We took alſo above four hundred and fifty Priſoners, of the chief of whom, and thoſe killed, there was ſhortly after a Liſt, in Print, which time has informed me of ſome miſtakes in, tho poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly there may be ſome as yet remaining.</p>

               <p> The Line of Battel will direct you how many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments we had in the Fight, and conſidering all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, they could not make up ſeventeen thouſand Horſe and Foot. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> were nigh Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and Five Thouſand Horſe and Dragoons, as appears from the moſt Rational Accounts that can be gathered from the number of their Regiments, and the Confeſſion of their own Officers; ſo that it may ſeem incredible to a great many, that in ſo long and ſharp an Engagement, with ſo great odds and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, that we had not a great many more Men killed and wounded on our ſide. But this is not ſo great a wonder in this Kingdom, if we'll look back upon the ſeveral Conflicts that our Anceſtors have had with that unhappy People: tho in this laſt War, four parts in five of theſe againſt us were degenerate <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Nor ever were they under ſo good Diſcipline, or yet ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous formerly as now, which no doubt made the Battle much ſharper; tho' it may ſeem ſtrange that thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that are Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, ſhould out of their blind Zeal to Popery, ſo quite forget from whence they came, that they joyn with the meer <hi>Iriſh,</hi> againſt all the Ties of Nation, Blood, and indeed of Intereſt. But as the Nature of Man is apter to degenerate than improve; ſo do the <hi>Engliſh</hi> oftner fall in love with the Barbarous Cuſtoms of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> than on the contrary. Hence we read of the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi>'s complaining that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were taking away their Eſtates and Countrey; and adviſes the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to join with him in their Defence: and yet his own Family had not been then in <hi>Ireland,</hi> above three Generations, and not that difference of Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Natives as now; and it's obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſeveral Families removing out of <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> call themſelves by the Counties in <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:99346:98"/> from whence they came, for two or three Generations, and then forgetting thoſe, they often turn meer <hi>Iriſh;</hi> for put a drop of Wine into a pint of Water, and it preſently ſo far incorporates, as you can by no means diſcern it: ſo is it often with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Family that has the Misfortune to be planted amongſt the meer <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh;</hi> for it ſoon becomes of the ſame ſtamp with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The conſequence of which has been lookt upon to be ſo pernicious to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that not only the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have been forbid Coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation with the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> but there was a time when <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Burrough,</hi> then Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> amongſt other Inſtructions, had Charge to enquire <hi>what</hi> Engliſh <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers had, contrary to their Covenants, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered</hi> Iriſh <hi>Men to Inhabit their Lands.</hi> Cox, Vol. 1. Page 413.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall forbear this Subject for ſome time; and ſince I am run abroad, I ſhall give you ſome of many <note place="margin">Inſtances in former times wherein the <hi>Iriſh</hi> loſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, with ſmall loſs to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh.</hi>
                  </note> Inſtances, wherein the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have been formerly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that with very little Loſs to the <hi>Britains.</hi> To omit therefore the inequality of Numbers, at the firſt Conqueſt; and the little loſs commonly on our ſide, in thoſe great Victories then obtained: In the Year 1316. <hi>William de Burgo,</hi> and <hi>Richard de Brimingham,</hi> encountred <hi>Falany O Connor,</hi> King of <hi>Conaught,</hi> and killed the King, with 8000 of his Men, near <hi>Athenree,</hi> with very little loſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and yet the numerous Off-ſpring of thoſe brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commanders, are all, or moſt of them, at this day reputed <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and have declared themſelves for that Intereſt. <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>9th.</hi> 1336. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> gave the <hi>Iriſh</hi> another defeat in <hi>Conaught,</hi> with the loſs of one Man, killing Ten Thouſand of their Enemies. And <hi>Anno</hi> 1504. the Lord Deputy <hi>Kildare</hi> fought with <hi>Bourk</hi> (then turned <hi>Iriſh,)</hi> and a great many other
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99346:98"/> 
                  <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lords in a ſtrong Confederacy at <hi>Knocklow,</hi> on the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and killed four thouſand (ſome ſay 9000.) and not one man killed or hurt on his ſide.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1566. Col. <hi>Randolph</hi> Governour of <hi>Derry,</hi> ſallyed thence with 300 Foot and 50 Horſe upon <hi>O Neal,</hi> who then deſigned to Beſiege the Town; In which Sally, Four Hundred of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were killed, without the loſs of one <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Col. <hi>Randolph</hi> himſelf. <hi>James Fitz-Maurice,</hi> and others were alſo Defeated in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, and Four Hundred of them killed, without the loſs of one <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, except a Servant of one Captain <hi>Malby</hi>'s</p>
               <p>And Sir <hi>George Bingham</hi> Routed a Party of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Iriſh</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways come off the loſers.</note> Commanded by the <hi>Bourks,</hi> at a place called <hi>Ardaner,</hi> being three thouſand in number, of whom only Seven eſcaped, and yet very little loſs to Sir <hi>George</hi>'s ſide. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> 1647. Six thouſand of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are ſaid to be killed at the Battle of <hi>Dungan-Hills,</hi> fought by Maj. Gen. <hi>Jones,</hi> and not above Twenty <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſlain.</p>
               <p>And what wonder is it then, if the Battle of <hi>Aghrim,</hi> the Greateſt and Beſt that ever the <hi>Iriſh</hi> fought, ſhould be won with the loſs of ſo few on our ſide. But ſuch is the unhappineſs of that People, that tho they always have the worſt of it: yet <hi>Campion</hi> makes this ſevere Remark upon them, and affirms, <hi>That notwithſtanding their Oaths and their Pledges, they are no longer true than they find themſelves the Weaker.</hi> And indeed all things conſidered, it can be reckoned no other than a misfortune to <hi>England,</hi> in having that Iſland ſo near adjoyning, whoſe Inhabitants have all along differed from us in Language and in Intereſt; and of late alſo in Religion too. Hence ſad experience tells us, that the Blood and Treaſure of <hi>England</hi> have been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted

                  <hi>Aghrim,</hi> with an Account of a Prophecy, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had of a Battle to be fought at this place. I was told by a Gentleman, who lives now in that Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that at leaſt a year before the Battle was fought, ſeveral of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter Creights,</hi> driving their Cattle that way, ſome of them askt this Gentlman the name of that Caſtle, who when he told them that it was called <hi>Aghrim:</hi> one of them replied, <hi>that was the place where a great Battle was to be fought;</hi> and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men ſhould think their Coats too heavy in climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up thoſe Hills. This was alſo mentioned by Col. <hi>Gordon O Neal</hi> (found ſtript amongſt the Dead next day, and made a Priſoner) and ſeveral other of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers after the Battle, which kind of Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are never rightly underſtood till they are paſt: for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> interpreted this to ſignifie the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mens running away from them, but they found it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thought their Coats too heavy in the purſuit of the Enemy: tho ſome ſay this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is meant of the Hills near <hi>Ardee,</hi> the day before the Battle at the <hi>Boyn,</hi> which was ſo Hot, that very few were able to carry their Coats. Nor is there any other people more Superſtitious in this point than the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and yet ſome of their Predictions are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, eſpecially at <hi>Kingſale,</hi> when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> landed there, where the Lord <hi>Montjoy,</hi> then Lord Lieutenant, was ſhewed the Ground ſeveral days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whereon the Great <hi>O Neal</hi> was defeated by him. And this was done by an old Prophecy, which pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99346:100"/> named and deſcribed the place. Towards the end alſo of the former Wars in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whilſt <hi>Ireton</hi> lay before <hi>Limerick,</hi> my Lord <hi>Broghill</hi> was ſent with a Detachment out of the Army to a place called <hi>Knocknaclaſhy,</hi> to obſerve a Body of the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> My Lord found ſeveral people got there before him, on purpoſe to expect the fate of the laſt Battle of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be fought on that Ground, as their Prediction run; and tho the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Forces were as then not upon the Spot, yet it ſo fell out that the Battle was fought there; the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Routed, and this the laſt Field-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict that happened during thoſe Wars. I have heard alſo ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> tell us before we got theither that we ſhould not ſucceed at the firſt Siege of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick:</hi> and they had no other reaſon for it but becauſe one of their Propheſies ſaid ſo.</p>
               <p>But I have ſpent too much time in theſe trifles, and <note place="margin">Our Army lay upon their Armes all night.</note> therefore to return: Whoever have been concerned in like Caſes, may eaſily imagine what ſatisfaction it was to the General and whole Army, to find themſelves entirely Maſters of the Field, and their Enemies all diperſed; but the day being gone, and few of our Tents come up, the men were ordered to lye upon their Armes all Night: their dead Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries (who two hours before had made a conſiderable Buſtle) lay now very quietly by without diſturbance. Next day the General ordered a publick thankſgiving to be kept, through the Army, for this happy Victory, and gave command that all our own dead ſhould be Buried, and thoſe of the Enemy alſo that lay on the ground where our Tents were to be pitched. But the reſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> remained ſtill unburied, no Inhabitants being left in that part of the Countrey to perform it; for it has been an Ancient Cuſtom amongſt them, ſtill to remove out of the way with their Cattle and all their Subſtance, at the approach of an Enemy: And
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:99346:100"/> Judge <hi>Cox</hi> obſerves that in the Year 1178, towards the beginning of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government in <hi>Ireland, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aught</hi> was invaded by <hi>Miles Coghan,</hi> and Young <hi>Fitz-Stephens:</hi> but they were forced to return for want of Proviſions, which has ſince fruſtrated more well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived deſigns, and great Expeditions, than any other Accident. But this was not our caſe at this time, and the greateſt miſchief that happened by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving, was to have the Carcaſſes of their Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for want of Burial, expoſed to the Birds of the Air, and the Beaſts of the Field; many Doggs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the place, afterwards and growing ſo fierce by feeding upon mans Fleſh, that it became dangerous for any ſingle man to paſs that way. And there is a true and remarkable Story of a Greyhound belonging to an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officer: the Gentleman was killed and ſtript in the Battle, whoſe Body the Dog remained by night and day; and tho he fed upon other Corps with the reſt of the Dogs, yet he would not allow them or any thing elſe to touch that of his Maſter. When all the Corps were conſumed, the other Dogs departed, but this uſed to go in the Night to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Villages for Food, and preſently to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the place where his Maſters Bones were only then left: and thus he continued till <hi>January</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, when one of Col. <hi>Foulks</hi>'s Soldiers being quartered nigh hand, and going that way by chance, the Dog fearing he came to diſturb his Maſters Bones, flew upon the Soldier: who being ſurprized at the ſuddenneſs of the thing, unſlung his Piece, then upon his back, and killed the poor Dog.</p>
               <p>Next morning after the Battle, one <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> and ſix Troopers came from the Enemy, and told us that what of the Army was left, made the beſt of their way towards <hi>Limerick:</hi> But that they were ſo

And on the <hi>14th.</hi> thoſe places were Surrendred upon Condition to march out with their Arms and Baggage: Firſt towards our Camp, where they had liberty to lay down their Arms, if they pleaſed; or elſe to go on towards the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army. <hi>Loughrea, Melick,</hi> and other places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts were alſo Deſerted by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who moſt of them took towards <hi>Limerick,</hi> as the ſafeſt place of Retreat: whither they went in no kind of order, but rather like people going to a Fair, the Roads as they paſſed being full of Hampers and other ſtuff, which they had been in too great haſt to lug along; yet that very night after the Battle they Robbed and Plundred one another upon the Road. That Evening it was ordered that all the Officers that were not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Duty, ſhould be at the General's Quarters next Morning at 9 of the Clock, to attend the Funeral of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Gen. <hi>Holſtaple:</hi> and what Soldiers would bring in Muskets to the Artillery, ſhould have 6<hi>d.</hi> a piece for them: by which means they brought in a great many Waggon loads full of the Arms loſt and thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and tho the price was reduced to two pence afterwards, yet there ſtill came a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in. Our Hoſpital was then pitched at <hi>Garbally,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Miles nearer <hi>Athlone:</hi> and it was likewiſe ordered that if there were any Sick or Wounded men that were not ſent to the Hoſpital, they ſhould be brought to the Artillery at Five in the Morning, where they would find Waggons to carry them to <hi>Athlone,</hi> Six Hundred Waggons being then ordered to bring
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99346:101"/> up Bread and other Proviſions from the Stores, which by that time were fixed there.</p>
               <p>The <hi>15th.</hi> Major <hi>O Connor,</hi> and 60 men that had been Garriſoned at <hi>Banoher</hi> Bridge came to our Camp, where 40 of the men laid down their Armes, to whom the General gave 5 <hi>s.</hi> a piece for encouragement, and ever after the <hi>Iriſh</hi> deſerted apace.</p>

Thoſe were the Congregational Party, who ſometimes condemned the Ceſſation, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times they approved of it; But at laſt they Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated the then Marquiſs of <hi>Ormond,</hi> for acting by the Kings Commiſſion, tho he valued themſelves very little, and their Excommunication much leſs.

               <p>This place we found Plundred by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, as well their own People as the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers giving their Countrey-men this reaſon for what they did, <hi>that they had better be Plundred by their own people, than give what they had to the Engliſh Army, who would certainly ſtrip them in a day or two more.</hi>

               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:99346:102"/>
               <p> There was a Religious Houſe in the Town, built at firſt, by <hi>Miles Bruningham,</hi> in the Year 1241; and tho it had been defaced when other Monaſteries were ſuppreſſed, yet the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had pretty well repaired it again. But upon our Approach, the Monks had left their Houſe, and greateſt part of their Books. By the Ruines of two Churches, within the Walls, and another Religious Place or two without, it appears a Town of ſome Antiquity; and I find this to be the place where <hi>Bruningham</hi> defeated the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and ſlew Eight Thouſand of them; the Town being walled afterwards, with the Money raiſed of Armour, and ſpoil gotten from the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> for every one of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that had double Armour of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> gave one half towards the Walls of the Town; of which <hi>Bruningham</hi> was made Baron, and one <hi>John Huſſey,</hi> a Butcher, did wonderful Feats that Day.</p>
               <p>Afterwards frequent skirmiſhes happened hereabouts, between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and the Town it ſelf was burnt in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, by the <hi>Mackan Earla</hi>'s, the Church not eſcaping; one of them ſaying, upon his being told that his Mother was buried in it, <hi>That if ſhe were alive, he would ſooner burn her, and it together, than that any</hi> Engliſh <hi>Churle ſhould fortifie there.</hi> Soon after this, 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Tax was laid by the Lord Deputy to Rebuild the Town; but as they were about it, and the Work well nigh finiſhed, the New Gates were ſet on Fire again, by my Lord <hi>Clanrickards</hi> Sons, who paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Shannon,</hi> and changed their <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for <hi>Iriſh</hi> Apparel, then ſackt the Town, drove away the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and defaced the Queens Arms. This place it ſeems has not been very conſiderable ſince, by reaſon of the Condition we found it in. Our Army encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Plains, not far from the Town, the General
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99346:102"/> going with a Party, three Miles nearer <hi>Galway:</hi> from whence being upon a riſing Ground, we could ſee into the Bay, where there lay then Six Ships; Three of which went off that Night. It was given out in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that the Men ſhould be kept cloſe in the Camp, and to be ready to March in a Minutes warning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beat of Drum; but on farther Conſideration, we reſted. On the <hi>18th.</hi> the General going, with a Party, to a place called <hi>O Ranmore,</hi> ſeated upon the very end of the Bay of <hi>Galway,</hi> which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had burnt ſome days before; His Excellency thought it not convenient to approach ſo nigh, as to view the Town of <hi>Galway,</hi> which we could not do without went within half a Mile of it, tho not one of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> appeared; for they had only a few Scampering Dragoons in Town; and therefore when the General had viewed the moſt convenient ways to March his Guns and Carriages, and ſent an Aid du Camp to diſcover who Major General <hi>Scravemore</hi> was, who had gone abroad alſo, with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty another way; he returned to the Camp, whither one Mr. <hi>Shaw,</hi> a Merchant, and ſome others, came <note place="margin">Some Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants eſcape out of <hi>Galway,</hi> and inform the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the ſtate of that place.</note> from <hi>Galway,</hi> and gave the General a full Account how matters ſtood within; that the Garriſon were only 7 Regiments, and thoſe neither full, nor well Armed; that they agreed not amongſt themſelves about keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſurrendring the Town, tho it was probable they would never abide a brisk Attack; that <hi>D'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſone,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Lieutenant General was there, and that my Lord <hi>Dillon</hi> was Governour, and that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Balderick O Donnel,</hi> with his Party to come into Town, by way of <hi>Ire, Conaught,</hi> without whom they were not in a Condition to make Reſiſtance. The heat of Expectation, from this <hi>Iriſh</hi> Deliverer, was now pretty well cooled; and at the Battle of <hi>Aghrim,</hi> he was at one Mr. <hi>Miller</hi>'s, at <hi>Bally-Cuſhean,</hi> about Six
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99346:103"/> Miles from <hi>Tuam,</hi> having a Party of about one Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men at <hi>Hedford, Ballinrobe,</hi> and up and down the Country, who upon the News of the Battle, were for marching in all haſte towards the Mountains: but not ſeeing our Army approach ſo ſoon as they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. <hi>Balderock,</hi> at the Inſtigation of one <hi>Linch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> a Popiſh-Prieſt, and one who called himſelf Dean of <hi>Tuam,</hi> ſent back a Party to that Town, who alledging that the People were making great Preparations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army; they ſtript the Inhabitants, and burnt the Place, at ſuch a time, when the People not only expected to get in their Harveſt, but alſo hoped for the Protection of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army; but found the contrary, as well to their diſappointment as loſs. This Town is dignified with an Archiepiſcopal Seat, and is that where the firſt Caſtle that ever was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as to any pile of Lime and Stone, was built in the Year 1161. by <hi>Rotherick O Connor,</hi> the Monarch; and for the rarity called <hi>Caſtrum Mirificum.</hi> The Inhabitants here inform us that the Town was burnt in the former Wars, by <hi>O Donnel</hi>'s Grandfather, who turning about from a riſing Ground, and beholding the Flames, he fell down dead from his Horſe, without ever ſpeaking another word. With the Pillage of this Town, and ſome other Places of the Country about, <hi>Balderock,</hi> and his Party, marched to a Place called <hi>Cong,</hi> amongſt the Mountains, in the County of <hi>Mayo;</hi> his Men were then dwindled away, and not above Six Hundred in Number. So that he was ſo far from being ſerviceable to <hi>Galway,</hi> that his Deſign was to keep amongſt the Mountains, till he could make Terms for himſelf, upon which account he writ to the General, before our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my removed from <hi>Galway.</hi>

               <p> Nigh the ſame time Judge <hi>Daily</hi> who lived in that part of the Country had ſent to the General, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a Party might be ſent for him, who ſhould ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly force him from his Habitation; this Gentleman and ſome others of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had kept a Correſpondence with our Government for ſeveral Months paſt, and had propoſed the ſurrendring of <hi>Galloway,</hi> and ſome other things, which was the occaſion of a part of our Armies marching to the <hi>Shannon</hi> the Winter before, but whether they were real and ſincere in what they propoſed, or they did it only to gain time, and by that means to benefit their own Party, may well be queſtioned, ſince thoſe very men continue ſtill the greateſt Patrons of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and what they told the General at that time was at beſt a Miſtake, for they informed him that the Gariſon of <hi>Gallway</hi> was five thouſand men at leaſt, and thoſe well armed, that the Stores were conſiderable, and the Town almoſt impregnable, that <hi>Sarcefield</hi> with the whole Body of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe was upon his march with a Reſolution to raiſe the Siege, and that <hi>Balderock</hi>'s Party was above ſix thouſand ſtrong; But tho' the General had no great reaſon to believe all this, yet he thought it convenient to ſuppoſe the worſt, and therefore was doubtful whether to befiege the Town, or to ſtay for the heavy Cannon which were at <hi>Athlone:</hi> yet upon the repeated Aſſurances of ſeveral Proteſtants that thoſe were only Tricks to gain time, he reſolved to approach the Town of <hi>Gallway</hi> the day following. Orders were therefore given out that the Army ſhould march in two Colums, with an hundred men of each Wing for a Rear Guard, Commanded by a Lieutenant Collonel of the Right-Wing: A Captain, Lieutenant, and Enſign with fifty Fire-Locks were to march at the Head of each Regiment.</p>

The Town <note place="margin">The Town deſcribed.</note> of <hi>Galloway</hi> is no doubt one of the Ancienteſt and Greateſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and yet I do not find many remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things of it formerly, it being always rather a place of Trade than Action of another Nature: It was firſt governed by a Provoſt, then Sovereign and Bayliffs, then a Mayor and Bayliffs, now by a Mayor and Sheriffs, It was moſt of it burnt in the year 1500. but ſoon rebuilt by reaſon of the Richneſs of the Inhabitants: the Houſes within the Walls are generally very ſtrong, and the Streets narrow; it was blockt up by Sir <hi>Charles Coot,</hi> and Major General <hi>Ludlow</hi> in the year 1652. and ſurrendred to Sir <hi>Charles</hi> on the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> following, the loſs of which carried with it at that time the Fate of <hi>Ireland.</hi> There lived a great many rich Merchants in it of late by reaſon of the conveniency of its Situation for Trade with <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> but moſt of them are <hi>Iriſh,</hi> which might be one great reaſon to expect the having it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered upon reaſonable Terms, rather than by reſiſtance to have it ruined. The Town is Seated at the Foot of a narrow ridge of Land, having <hi>Galloway-Bay</hi> on the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>South-Eaſt,</hi> a large River coming from <hi>Lough Cerbe</hi> on the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and towards the <hi>North</hi> there lies a low Bog, through the midſt of which runs a narrow but deep River proceeding from the Great one that ſlides by the Town: this River and Bog each about a Mile and an half towards the <hi>North-Eaſt,</hi> and then end together, the River ſinking under ground at the Foot of a large Hill; but appears again at an Old Caſtle nigh

                  <hi>Oran-More,</hi> where it runs into the utmoſt Creek of the Bay. The Ridge of Land between the Bog and the Bay towards the Eaſt is but very narrow, and may with no great difficulty be Fortified, without which the Town is not to be defended ſince an Army may approach under covert of this Ridge within leſs then an hundred Yards of the Town-wall, where there is a riſing Ground that overlooks a great part of the Town. There had been ſome works upon the neck of this Ridge in former times, and the <hi>French</hi> had begun to repair them, but had not brought them to any perfection; the <hi>Iriſh</hi> however were hard at work upon a Fort at the end of this Ridge, and nigh the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> Corner of the Wall, they had levelled all the Hedges nigh the Town, as alſo the Suburbs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Eaſt-Gate,</hi> and ſeveral very ſtrong Works were caſt up to defend that part of the Town: within the Wall on that ſide there ſtands a round Citadel with eight Guns, having a Platform nigh it of ſix Guns more, at the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> corner of the Wall were eight or ten Guns planted; there ſtands alſo a Turret towards the middle of a large Curtain that runs along next the Bay, on which were three Guns, and towards the River they had planted five more, which with thoſe that lookt towards the <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>North,</hi> made in all about forty ſix Guns, moſt of which were amounted upon little mean Carriages, ſomething like thoſe they commonly have on Ship-board.

               <p>Seventeen Rapparees were killed in the County of <hi>Kildare</hi> by two Parties of the Militia, and three hanged at <hi>Edenderry;</hi> five hundred of the Militia of the County of <hi>Cork</hi> under the Command of Colonel <hi>Beecher</hi> met with about four hundred of the Iriſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a place called <hi>Shibbareene,</hi> and after a ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Enemy were put to flight, by which means our Party had almoſt ſurpriz'd <hi>Mackarty Moore</hi> and Colonel <hi>O Donavan</hi> who were not far off, the Enemy loſt nigh ſixty, and the Militia got a conſiderable Booty of Cattle, and nigh the ſame time one <hi>Barry</hi> a Captain with ten of his men deſerted from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>

               <p>The Third our Army marched to <hi>Bir,</hi> but the paſſage over the Bridge at <hi>Banoher,</hi> being exceeding troubleſom, it was late before the Guns and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages could be got up, and therefore we reſted on the Fourth.

               <p>The Fifth we marched to <hi>Buraſicane,</hi> where there had been a pretty Engliſh Plantation, but burnt down the former Winter, by the Garriſon of <hi>Bir,</hi> becauſe they did not deſire to have the <hi>Rapparees</hi> in ſo near a Neighbourhood.</p>

                        </note> to apprehend that <hi>O Donnel</hi> is not ſo ſincere in his Treaty as is to be wiſhed: For that reaſon, aſſoon as you have convoyed the Cannon till they join the Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the Marqueſs <hi>La Forreſt</hi>'s Command, I would have you return with your Regiment to <hi>Athlone,</hi> and ſend the Northern Militia back to their Country, to prevent any Inroads he may make that way.

               <p>But this was only Miſinformation, for <hi>O Donnel</hi> made it appear afterwards that he was ſincere in his Intentions, and that he had no mind to join with Sir <hi>Teague O Regan,</hi> as was ſuſpected. The <hi>21st</hi> the Badneſs of the Weather increaſed, and ſeveral Regiments were forced to remove their Camps, the Water overflowing their former Ground. Major <hi>O Conner</hi> and nine more deſert the Enemy, and inform the General, that if we had either of the Paſſes at <hi>Killalow</hi> or <hi>Bryans-Bridg,</hi> a great many of the Enemies Horſe and Dragoons would deſert. And this Evening our Tinboats came up to the Camp, being brought by Water from <hi>Athlone</hi> towards <hi>Killalow.</hi>

                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> was ſent by the General to the Squadron of Ships then in the River, with Orders for them to ſail nearer the Town. The 23<hi>d</hi> two hundred and fifty freſh Draught-Horſes were ſent out to haſten up the Train; and each Regiment was ordered to make ready 2000 Faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to begin the Work at <hi>Limerick.</hi> One <hi>Dowdall</hi> a Counſellor, and <hi>Sheldon</hi> a Lieutenant in the Iriſh Foot-Guards, deſert: and two Troopers and a Sutler were condemned at a Court Martial, the two Troopers for robbing, and the Sutler for buying Goods of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the General's ſtrict Orders. That Evening alſo our Guns came within ſight of the Camp: and the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now ſeeming to promiſe us our wonted Succeſs, the General reſolved to move forwards; but ſince the Iriſh Army were all in and about the Town, and 'twas proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they might deſign us ſome Trouble in our Approach, therefore it was ordered that at break of Day next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Army ſhould be ready to march, but without beat of Drum; ſix hundred Horſe, three hundred Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, and one thouſand Firelocks, and two hundred Granadeers out of each Line for an Advance-Party: theſe were to march in two Lines at the Head of either Wing, with four Field-pieces each, and twenty five Pioneers a piece to cut down any Rubs that might be in their way; the whole Body of Horſe were to march after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached Foot, with each Man three Faſcines before him, which they were to leave where ordered; ſo that the Enemy might ſee we were reſolved to ſpare no Pains, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than go without the Town a ſecond time. Then all the Foot were to march, and after them the Train; and no Baggage whatever to march near the detached Party, who were to march directly to the Quakers Houſe, and there to make a Halt till the Foot came up. Then the Right Line to fall into the Road on the right Hand, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:99346:122"/> the Left Line on the other Road from the Quakers Houſe: and all to draw up afterwards in order of Battel; ſo to march eaſily towards the Town, making ſeveral Halts to obſerve the Enemies Motion. Theſe Orders I have ſet down, to ſhew the Reader the Method of approaching Towns, when an Army expects Oppoſition from an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, though the Iriſh did not give us much diſturbance in this. But before we leave <hi>Cariganleſs,</hi> I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may be worth the Reader's while to be informed of a Tradition that the People in the Neighbourhood have concerning 2 old Caſtles that ſtand nigh half a Mile from this place, and not above a ſtone's caſt one from another: they ſay that in former times two <hi>Brehons,</hi> or Iriſh Judges, lived in thoſe two Caſtles, who hapned at laſt to have ſome Diſputes about their Properties; and their Wives, though they were Siſters, uſed to ſtand upon the Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their own Houſes, and ſcold at one another for ſeveral hours together; which at length one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary of, ſhe found out a Trick only to appear and begin the Fray, then ſhe would place an Image that ſhe had dreſs'd up in her own Clothes, in ſuch a poſture as her Siſter could not diſcern it from her ſelf at that diſtance; who not ſenſible of the Cheat, ſhe uſed to ſcold on, and at laſt fretted her ſelf to death, becauſe ſhe could not be anſwered in her own Language. But I'm afraid the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in this Country will ſcarce pardon this Story: And therefore according to the former Orders,</p>
               <p>Friday the <hi>25th,</hi> the Army marched towards <hi>Limerick,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Our Army ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the City of <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</hi>
                  </note> leaving two Regiments of Foot and one hundred Horſe till the Cannon come up next day. Our Advance-Party of Horſe and Dragoons met with no great Oppoſition, only ſome ſmall firings between them and the Iriſh Out-Guards, with no great damage to either ſide. We made our Approaches much after the ſame manner we did the Year before, tho we drew more to the Left, and nearer
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99346:122"/> the <hi>Shannon,</hi> but fix'd our Camp further from the Town.</p>
               <p>When greateſt part of our Army was got up, our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached Body of Foot, under the Command of Lieut. Gen. <hi>Mackay,</hi> was ordered to Attack <hi>Ireton</hi>'s Fort, and the old Church-Fort, where we expected the Enemy had lodged a Party; our Men made a Line croſs the Fields, and were ſuſtained by ſeveral entire Regiments of Foot, and a Body of Horſe. We advanced towards both the Forts at one time, and found the upper one deſerted: and when we came almoſt within Muſquet-ſhot of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Fort, the Iriſh quitted that alſo, and retired towards a little ſtone Fort nigh the Outworks of the Town. Our Men ſeeing them draw off, ruſhed forwards and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but to no great purpoſe, for the Enemy, after ſome faint Returns, preſently lodged themſelves in the other Fort: And towards the Evening Count <hi>Naſſau</hi> with a Party attacked <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Fort, ſtanding to the left of the other, which the Iriſh had made pretty defenſible, and wherein they had then about 500 Men lodged: Our Granadeers were in the Front, who were ſaluted with a Volley of Shot from the Enemy; but this being a thing they were now pretty well uſed to, they ran forwards, and threw in their Granades; and then being followed by the whole Party, the Iriſh in leſs than half an Hour left the Fort to our Diſcretion: We had only tow or three killed, and the Enemy about ten, though ſome made them a great many more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> in the former Wars of <hi>Ireland,</hi> never went further than <hi>Clonmel;</hi> for there receiving Orders from the Parliament to go for <hi>England,</hi> he entruſted the Management of the Army to <hi>Ireton;</hi> who at the beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Limerick,</hi> built ſeveral Forts; two of the moſt remarkable, bearing the Names of <hi>Ireton</hi>'s and <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi>'s, were now ordered to be called <hi>Mackay</hi>'s and <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau</hi>'s
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99346:123"/> Forts, becauſe gained under thoſe Commanders; and by thoſe Names we ſhall call them for the future; when there is occaſion to mention them. When we came up towards the Town, we found a Man newly hanged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gallows, who the Iriſh ſaid was an Officer of theirs, and put there for endeavouring to deſert to our Army. The General having ſome Intimation of a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley deſigned from the Town that Night, and judging it not improbable, ſince they had ſo good a Body of Horſe behind it, he commanded therefore that our Horſe ſhould not unſaddle, but each Troper to lie all Night by his Horſe's Head, to be ready upon the firſt Alarm. Col. <hi>Donep,</hi> who commanded our advance Party of Horſe, was killed that Evening by a random Shot; being a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who had a very good Character, both among the Danes and Engliſh.</p>
               <p>The <hi>26th</hi> all our Train came up, as alſo a great many Carriages with Bombs, Ball, Shovels and Pickaxes, and 800 Barrels of Powder. This Night we broke Ground, and made our Approaches with no great loſs, caſting up ſome Works nigh the <hi>Shannon</hi> towards the Weſt, behind which the Danes encamped, and maintained that part of the Work during the Siege. We improved alſo theſe Forts deſerted by the Iriſh, and drew a new Line from the old Church Fort to <hi>Mackay</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>The <hi>27th</hi> in the Morning the Prince of <hi>Heſs</hi> with his <note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Heſs</hi> ſent to <hi>Caſtle-Connel.</hi>
                  </note> own Regiment, Col. <hi>Tiffin</hi>'s, and Col. <hi>St. John</hi>'s, five pieces of Cannon, and about 700 Horſe and Dragoons, marched to <hi>Caſtle-Connel,</hi> which we had not blown up effectually laſt Year, and wherein the Iriſh had now a Gariſon of 250 Men. They refuſed the Prince's Proffers to them at firſt; but after two Days Siege, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be all made Priſoners of War. The ſame Day Maj. Gen. <hi>Scravemore</hi> went with another Party, and four Guns, to <hi>Carick-a-Gunnel,</hi> a Caſtle upon the River, three
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99346:123"/> miles below the Town, wherein was a Gariſon of 150 Men, who alſo ſubmitted to be Priſoners of War, as did one or two Caſtles more; the leaving theſe Detachments in ſuch places being very inaccountable, ſince they had a mind to defend them no better. This ſeems rather want of Inſtructions what to do, than Courage to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it; for to give the Iriſh their due, they can defend ſtone Walls very handſomly. We read that Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> Preſident of <hi>Munſter</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, took the Caſtle of <hi>Dunboy</hi> in the Weſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> by Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, where the Iriſh made the moſt reſolute Defence of any of the like nature before or ſince; for the Gariſon being 130 choice Men, were all either killed or hanged for holding out; and ſome of them defended the very Vaults during a whole Night, though all the reſt of the Caſtle was taken; and one <hi>Mack Geoghagan</hi> being deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wounded, when he ſaw the Engliſh enter the Vault, he endeavoured to caſt a lighted Candle into a Barrel of Powder to blow himſelf and them up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but was prevented in his Deſign, and ſo died.</p>
               <p>The Iriſh planted two Field-pieces on the oppoſite ſide the River, by which they obliged two Regiments of our Dragoons that lay cloſe to the <hi>Shannon</hi> to remove; but as ſoon as we had placed ſome Guns to flank their ſmall Battery, they drew off. Orders were given to fit up 600 Bombs, and 1000 Hand-Granades: and in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon eighteen of our Ships came up the River, within a mile of the Town, and fired ſome Shots into the Iriſh <note place="margin">Our Ships come nigh the Town.</note> Horſe-Camp as they ſailed along, they being encamped at that time nigh the River, at a place called <hi>Craightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagh:</hi> This put ſeveral of the Iriſh much out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, for till then they were made believe, that either we had no Ships in the River, or elſe thoſe we had would quickly be ſwallowed up by the French Fleet, which they hourly expected.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:99346:124"/>
               <p> The <hi>28th</hi> an Order was ſent to <hi>Kinſale,</hi> for the reſt of the Proviſion-Ships then in that Harbour to ſail to the <hi>Shannon.</hi> And the General went on board ſome of thoſe Ships that came up the Day before, giving Command to bring on ſhoar ſeveral Pieces of new Cannon and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars; which was performed on the <hi>29th.</hi> And all the Priſoners that had been taken in ſeveral Caſtles, being about 400 in number, were ſent towards <hi>Clonmel,</hi> with a Party of Horſe and Dragoons to guard them. This Evening our Line of Circumvallation was finiſhed, and our other Works, by hard labour, much improved; the Enemy playing hot upon us from the King's Caſtle, and three more Batteries. Our Buſineſs was now to raiſe a Battery for ten Guns and ſeven Mortars, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before next Morning; and <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>30th</hi> our Guns and Mortars were drawn down to it: the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan immediately to play on <hi>Thoumond-Bridg,</hi> and the Houſes on that ſide the Town; at Night alſo our Bombs began to fly with pretty good Succeſs, 101 being thrown before next Morning.</p>
               <p>The Enemy now deſert <hi>Killmallock,</hi> a Town upon the <note place="margin">The Enemy deſert <hi>Killmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.</hi>
                  </note> Road between <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Limerick,</hi> whither the Iriſh flocked in great Numbers in former times, to welcome the Earl of <hi>Deſmond</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> who was ſent over upon ſome Reaſons of State by Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> their firſt Saluations were to throw Wheat and Salt upon him in token of Peace and Plenty: But next day, when they ſaw him go to Church, they fell to murmur, and ſpit at him, and never would own him more: And ſo hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was not only our Religion, but even the Civil Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and Cuſtoms of the Engliſh to ſome of them, that in the ſame Queen's Reign it was with much difficulty that ſome of the Iriſh Nobility could be perſwaded to put on their Robes, when they were to appear in the Houſe of Lords in time of Parliament. And I have heard it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:99346:124"/> by thoſe that knew it, that even in this laſt War, and (if I am not much miſtaken) in the Parliament that was held at <hi>Dublin</hi> by the late King too, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by ſome, to deſtroy all fine Houſes, and every thing elſe that look'd like Improvement, and ſo return to the former barbarous way of living of their Anceſtors, that it might not be worth the while for <hi>England,</hi> or any other Nation, to ſeek a new Conqueſt over them: but theſe Men did not conſider that <hi>England</hi> has been at too much Expence, and is now too well acquainted with <hi>Ireland,</hi> ever to be without it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> 31. One Capt. <hi>Morice,</hi> a Lieutenant, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Dragoons belonging to Sir <hi>Donald O-Neal</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſerted from beyond the River, and tell us, that the Enemy were mightily apprehenſive of our getting over; but that their Horſe and Dragoons would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to watch our Motion, and do all they could to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent us. Our Batteries play very hard all this Day; and at Night, four out of each Troop of Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons throughout the Army, were ordered to work at a new Battery, to the Right of the former, and ſomewhat nearer the Town; they wrought very ſtoutly, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed their Battery before next Morning. This was a thing very unuſual for Horſemen, eſpecially to work in Trenches; but there was in a manner a Neceſſity for it, for our Foot were upon Duty by whole Regiments eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſecond Night, beſide Detachments and Workmen upon ſundry Occaſions every Day: And therefore Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant General <hi>Withers</hi> was commanded to order the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments that marched to the Trenches, not to mount with Colours, that the Enemy might not be ſenſible how faſt our Duty came upon us.</p>
               <p>The ſame Day a Party of four hundred Horſe was <note place="margin">Brigadeer <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſon</hi> ſent into <hi>Kerry.</hi>

                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:99346:125"/> with ſeven hundred Horſe and Dragoons, went into the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> to reduce the Iriſh in thoſe Parts: Which ſome of the Inhabitants in other Places will needs call the moſt natural Iriſh in the Kingdom; and yet they ſay, every Cow-boy amongſt them can ſpeak Latin, on purpoſe to ſave them from the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, when they come afterwards to be tried for Theft: For though there be very ſevere Laws againſt it, and often put in Execution; yet Robbing, Plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Stealing, are accounted but ſmall Crimes amongſt the Natives, if not done to their Lords or Followers: for what they could purchaſe formerly, they thought it clear Gain, and Caſtles built to ſecure it; which thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Spirit is not as yet quite baniſhed that part of the Country, nor ſcarce any other part of the Kingdom.

               <p>About a Mile above <hi>Limerick,</hi> there lies a ſmall Iſland in the <hi>Shannon,</hi> called St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Iſland, where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſtood a Chappel dedicated to that Saint, but now ruinous, though at preſent there are two or three ſmall Houſes in the Iſland, and ſome little Incloſures. Here the Iriſh had kept ſeveral of the Proteſtants belonging to the City, under a Guard, for ſome time paſt; and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99346:125"/> now they were releaſed by Major <hi>Stroud,</hi> who kept Guard at <hi>Anighbegg</hi> with a Party of the County of <hi>Cork</hi> Militia; the Iriſh Captain, and ſome others of their Guard coming off alſo with them. But what can be a greater Teſtimony of a rapacious Humour than this? for ſome of the Militia ſtripp'd their Fellow-Proteſtants of what the Iriſh had left them, as they conducted them from the Iſland to our Camp; which I would not have ſaid, but that I had it from the Mouths of thoſe very People that were ſo ſerved; who during their ſtay in Town with other Proteſtants of all ſorts, had ſhewed the greateſt Affection and Compaſſion imaginable to thoſe of our Army that were Priſoners there: but now the Scene was altered; and all the ſhift that themſelves could make for ſome days, was to make up little Places to creep into amongſt the Faſcines that lay on heaps by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's Quarters, till our Waggons carried them farther off into the Countrey.</p>
               <p>This Night Major General <hi>Talmaſh</hi> commanded in the <note place="margin">Major General <hi>Talmaſh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in the Trenches.</note> Trenches, by whoſe Diligence and Example the Works were run nearer, and much ſtrengthned, though the Enemy fired very briskly all Night, and did us ſome Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.

               <p>But it's now time to leave the Camp a little, and look backwards to ſee what was done in other parts of the Kingdom during this Month of <hi>August.</hi> And firſt at <note place="margin">What hapned in other Parts of the Kingdom this Month.</note> 
                  <hi>Dublin,</hi> there was great care taken to procure as many Horſes as could be got for the neceſſary Occaſions of the Army. Proviſions likewiſe of all ſorts and Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were ſent up continually: and the Harveſt being now
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99346:126"/> almoſt ready, and very few Hands being left to take care of that Corn which the Iriſh had ſown in ſeveral places of <hi>Connaught,</hi> the Lords Juſtices therefore order a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be publiſhed, <hi>August</hi> the fourth; <q>That whereas ſince the Battel of <hi>Aghrim,</hi> and the Surrender of <hi>Galway,</hi> the Farmers, Cottiers, and other Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Connaught,</hi> had withdrawn themſelves, ſo that there were not Hands ſufficient to get in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt; It was therefore proclaimed, That all Farmers, Cottiers and Under-Tenants following the Enemies Camp, that ſhould within fifteen days return to their Habitations in <hi>Connaught,</hi> and apply themſelves to the bringing in the Harveſt, they ſhould not only quietly and peaceably enjoy their ſeveral Farms as they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſhould be fully and abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, if not guilty of private Murder. And that all Perſons that would mow the Graſs, and reap the Corn upon the Land of ſuch Abſentees as would not return themſelves, ſhould have one half of ſuch Corn and Hay to their own proper Uſe, and be protected in the quiet and peaceable Poſſeſſion thereof, behaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as good Subjects, and bringing the other half to ſome convenient Place upon the Farm for the King's Service.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But how good ſoever the Deſign might be, I heard of little Effect this Proclamation had: for ſeveral of the Iriſh laſt Spring had plowed and ſown their Lands in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,</hi> hoping we would never come thither; and thoſe that did not plow, expected to come over, and get e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough on our ſide the <hi>Shannon:</hi> but when they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in both theſe, they would yet go along with the Crowd in hopes of returning again in a ſmall time. And it's obſervable that there have not been ſo many Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99346:126"/> for many Years before amongſt the Iriſh, as was laſt Winter in <hi>Limerick, Galway,</hi> and all <hi>Connaught</hi> over; whether it was out of confidence that they ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be Maſters of the Kingdom after all, or elſe that they were crowded into a narrower Compaſs, and ſo had the more Opportunities of Courting, I leave others to judg.</p>

                  <hi>August</hi> the fourth, Sir <hi>Albert Cunningham</hi>'s Dragoons being left at <hi>Galway</hi> when the Army moved from thence, march'd now to <hi>Portumna</hi> and <hi>Athenree;</hi> and a hundred Foot detached under Major <hi>Smith,</hi> to <hi>Loughrea.</hi>

               <p>By Letters from <hi>Caſhell, August</hi> 5. the Government had notice that great Heats and Debates aroſe daily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the great Officers in the Iriſh Army; and that ſome Perſons endeavouring to get off for <hi>France,</hi> were forced back again, and the Ship taken, wherein the Goods belonging to Monſieur <hi>Saint Ruth,</hi> the late Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, were on board; and that ſeveral Ladies were forced aſhore in <hi>Kerry,</hi> or obliged to return to <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;</hi> and that a Privateer brought into <hi>Rye</hi> a Prize of ſix Guns and ſix Patereroes, bound from <hi>Limerick</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> having ſeveral Paſſengers on board; amongſt the reſt, my Lord <hi>Abercorne,</hi> who was killed in the Fight, as were ſeveral more killed and wounded on both ſides.

It <note place="margin">Our Bombs ſet the Town on fire.</note> was ordered that Afternoon, that moſt of our Guns and Mortars ſhould be ſhipp'd again; and at Night Maj. Gen. <hi>Tettan</hi> commands in the Works. A little after our Guards were relieved, we underſtood the Iriſh deſigned a Salley; in order to which, a conſiderable Body of their Men advanced towards our Works, between <hi>Naſſau</hi>'s Fort, and the great Battery where the Earl of <hi>Drogheda</hi> with his Regiment was then upon Duty.

               <p>A Council of War was this day held, and alſo a Court Martial, whereof the Earl of <hi>Drogheda</hi> was Preſident; at which, amongſt other things, a Woman was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for endeavouring to intice ſome of our French Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers into Town, whom ſhe took to be Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. This Evening two great Mortars, 18 Inches and an half Diameter, that were brought from Ship-board, were mounted, and ſeveral Bombs thrown; but they did not do the hoped-for Execution: which occaſioned the drawing them and the Guns off from the Batteries, with a deſign to attempt ſomething elſewhere, or, if it could be, to paſs the River: which the Enemy having private <note place="margin">A Deſign to paſs the River.</note> notice of, they removed their Horſe-Camp about two Miles to the North-Eaſt of <hi>Limerick,</hi> poſting four Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Dragoons to guard the <hi>Shannon</hi> below <hi>Anigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begg,</hi> where they had three Regiments of Foot lay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched. The Cannon however had been ſo troubleſom to the Inhabitants, that moſt of them left the Town, and encamp'd under Sheets and Blankets, with what elſe they could procure, nigh a Party of their Horſe, where they and their Army wanted nothing ſo much as Salt. The General ſeeing the Enemies Camp removed, went to a convenient Place to view them.</p>
               <p>The third, the Guns and Mortars put on board, were again unſhipp'd, (upon new Meaſures being taken) and brought up to the Artillery-Ground. One of Col. <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>'s
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99346:132"/> Dragoons deſerted from the Enemy, leaving them the Night before, and ſays that 17 Regiments of Horſe and Dragoons belonging to their Army, were moſt of them at that time beyond the River, but neither well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipp'd nor clad, nor were the Regiments nigh full.</p>
               <p>The <hi>4th,</hi> Lieut. Col. <hi>Peck</hi> with the Princeſs <hi>Ann</hi>'s Regiment, came to the Camp: and in the Evening a Party of 300 Horſe and Dragoons were ſent to reinforce Brigadeer <hi>Leveſon:</hi> and ſome Reports there were that he was ſurrounded by the Enemy; upon which the General ſent to him to return: but it proved only a Prey of Cows that the Enemy had taken from ſome of the Countrey-People, who had bought them from the Brigadeer's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the Rout they gave the Iriſh. However, the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadeer had Orders afterwards to ſecure the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> and to endeavour the reducing the Enemies Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons there, ſix Guns being ordered for that Service. For the Enemies keeping ſome ſmall Gariſons between our Camp and <hi>Cork,</hi> was a great Diſadvantage to us in point of Proviſions, which otherwiſe we might have expected Plenty of from that part of the Countrey. The Duke of <hi>Wyrtemberg</hi> (as 'tis ſaid) by the Advice of my Lord <hi>Caſtle-connel,</hi> who was come to our Camp, had <note place="margin">A new Battery contrived nigh the <hi>Kings Iſland</hi>
                  </note> now found out a Place for a new Battery, nigh the <hi>King's Iſland,</hi> on the River-ſide, which was thought nearer the Town than the former, and from whence we could bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Engliſh Town more effectually. This Place in our publick Accounts was ſaid to be within Carbine ſhot of the Wall, and yet it was at leaſt 300 Yards from it. Nor was there any Conveniency to raiſe a Battery any nearer againſt this part of the Town, by reaſon of the River to the Right, and a low Moraſs Ground on the Front. But ſome Diſputes about this new Battery were raiſed before it ſelf, though at laſt it was concluded on;
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99346:132"/> and ſeveral Regiments both of Horſe and Foot were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to move towards the Right, as well for the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Battery, as to front the Iriſh Army who were gone that way before us. We were at work alſo very hard upon a Line of Contravallation, raiſing three or four new Forts between the old Church and the <hi>King's Iſland,</hi> to ſecure the remaining part of our Army, in caſe ſome of them ſhould be commanded over the River.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>September</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> in the Evening we begun to work <note place="margin">The Battery begun.</note> at our new Battery. At firſt the Enemy did not diſcover us; but after ſome time the Moon ſhining very bright, they found us out, and fired both great and ſmall Shot very laviſhly, killing five or ſix; but ſtill the reſt went on bravely with their Work, and had ſoon brought it into ſuch a Condition as to ſecure themſelves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>6th,</hi> one <hi>Barnwell</hi> deſerted the Enemy, and tells us they ſeem reſolved to defend the Town, which they might do, except we paſſed the River, having all the County of <hi>Clare</hi> open to go out and in at pleaſure. Our Men work ſtill at the Battery, which being deſigned for a great many Guns, it could not be finiſhed in one Night, tho the Rain did us ſome Damage. This Night ſome Townſmen ſwam over the River, and confirm the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given by <hi>Barnwell</hi> the day before, that the Iriſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve not to give us the Town except we paſs the River, ſince they had a free Paſſage to bring in and take out what they pleaſed: and amongſt other things, they had forty Chirurgions Cheſts that landed from <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Kerry,</hi> which were conveyed croſs the River, and ſo into Town at <hi>Thoumond</hi> Gate. They informed us alſo that moſt of the Towns-people having left it, and the Souldiers lying continually in the Works, our Bombs did not do that Execution that was hoped for: but that upon whatever Houſe a Bomb fell, the Iriſh Souldiers preſently ruſhed
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99346:133"/> in and plundered it. And tho the Weather ſeemed to threaten us, yet this was no great Diſcouragement; ſince if it came to the worſt, we had now our Ships in the River, and could at any time put our Guns on board, which Conveniency we wanted the Year before.</p>
               <p>The General had now an Account from Brigadeer <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſon</hi> out of <hi>Kerry,</hi> that the Enemy according to their uſual way of deſtroying, had burnt <hi>Tralee;</hi> and that he had ſecured two of the Iriſh Captains that were active in that Affair: upon which he ſent the following Anſwer.</p>

                  <hi>September</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> this Letter was ſent the Brigadeer (then encamp'd at <hi>Lixnaw)</hi> by Capt. <hi>William Fitz-Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Drogheda</hi>'s Regiment, and Son to the Lord of <hi>Kerry,</hi> who this Morning left the Camp, with about twenty or thirty of that Country-Gentlemen in his Company, having alſo an Order for a Guard of Horſe and Dragoons from <hi>Asketon.</hi> But next Day coming to <hi>Liſtoell,</hi> within five Miles of the Brigadeer's Party, one
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99346:133"/> of the Enemies Dragoons miſtaking them for a Party of their own Men, came haſtily up and told them, he was at firſt afraid they had been Engliſh, but that my Lord <hi>Merion</hi>'s, my Lord <hi>Britta</hi>'s, Sir <hi>Maurice Euſtace,</hi> Sir <hi>James Cotter</hi>'s Dragoons, with a Body of between 3 and 4000 Iriſh, lay behind the Hill; this Fellow they immediately ſhot for his pains, and ſent to give the Brigadeer notice of their Danger, making all convenient haſte towards <hi>Lixnaw:</hi> But the Enemy ſoon had notice of them, and drew out ſeveral Parties to intercept their Paſſage; our Men however, with ſome difficulty, gained a Paſs: and yet the Iriſh ordered the matter ſo, as to be in a fair way to deſtroy them all, had not the Brigadeer appeared with a Party in the mean time; for having received an Account that the Iriſh were got into a Body in ſuch a place, he was going then with a Party to diſcover them, not knowing the Danger our own Men were in. Upon the Brigadeer's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, when our Men underſtood who it was, they gave a Huzzah: At which the Iriſh began to draw off; and being in great Confuſion, by reaſon of their eager haſte to purſue our ſmall Party, the Brigadeer fell upon them in that poſture, and killed about thirty, taking Lieut. Col. <hi>O Ryan,</hi> and about thirty more Priſoners, the reſt making too great haſte to the Woods and Bogs to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken. Our Party then went to the place where the Iriſh Camp had been, and found two Barrels of Powder, with a great deal of other Luggage, left behind.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Limerick</hi> the Enemy fired very briskly upon us all that day, with eight Guns which they had planted in the King's Iſland, and other places: However we finiſhed the Platform of the great Battery, and the flooring for the Mortars.</p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:99346:134"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>September</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> our new Batteries were all ready; one to the left of ten Field-pieces, to ſhoot red hot Ball; another to the right, of 25 Guns, all 24 and 18 Poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; <note place="margin">The Batteries finiſhed, and play upon the Town.</note> and in the Center were placed eight Mortars, from 18 Inches 3 quarters, to 10 ½ Diameter: theſe ſtood altogether upon the North-eaſt of the Town nigh the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland: then there were 8 Guns of 12 pound Ball each, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Fort; and ſome alſo towards the River on the South-weſt, where the Danes were poſted: Thoſe fell to work all at a time, and put the Iriſh into ſuch a fright, that a great many of them wiſh'd themſelves in another place, having never heard ſuch a Noiſe before, nor I hope never ſhall in that Kingdom. One of the great Mortars had a Shell burſt in her, flinging the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and Carriage nigh two yards from the flooring; which is demonſtration, that the firing the Fuſe before you give fire to the Mortar, is neither the readieſt nor the ſafeſt way; but this was the method of all our Foreign Bombardeers: tho one Lieut. <hi>Brown,</hi> afterwards at <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kay</hi>'s Fort, made uſe of a much better way, as ſhall in time be related. We threw Bombs, Fire-balls and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes all day long, and our Guns were diſcharged almoſt without ceaſing; by which there appeared a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Breach in the Wall, within the King's Iſland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <note place="margin">A Breach made</note> the Abbey and <hi>Ball</hi>'s Bridg; and our Bombs, Fire-balls and Carcaſſes, had the like ſucceſs upon the Houſes in Town.</p>
               <p>The <hi>9th</hi> more Proviſion-Ships are ordered from <hi>Cork,</hi> under the Smirna-Merchant. We improved our Forts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the old Church and our great Battery; and our Guns fire all day at the Breach, by which it was widened to a great Degree, and alſo a great many Houſes beat down: we diſmounted alſo two Guns from a Spur in the King's Iſland nigh <hi>Balls-Bridg,</hi> and play'd from <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Fort
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99346:134"/> upon four Guns more that diſturbed us, from a Place where their black Battery was the Year before. The Enemy had caſt up a Blind to prevent our beating down <hi>Balls-Bridg,</hi> but as our Battery was planted, the Blind was ineffectual, though we did not mind the Bridg much on that Side. A great many Bombs and Carcaſſes were thrown into Town, which ſet it on fire; and we underſtood afterwards that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral People were killed in the indeavouring to quench it. That Morning all the empty Casks in the Army were ordered to be taken up and carried to the Artillery, where they were to be made uſe of when there was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for Floats. The Enemy that Afternoon made a Pretence of ſallying; and ſome of them came out to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Ditch not far from our Battery, but were ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, and ſeveral of them killed, with the Loſs of one Granadeer on our Side. There was alſo a Work begun cloſe to the River-Side, adjoining to the Iſland, but the Spring-Tide over-flow'd it next Day. Though ſeveral Woolſacks were carried down in order to make an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack <note place="margin">Some thoughts of ſtorming it.</note> upon the Iſland, and from thence upon the Breach; but this being found difficult, the Woolſacks were left with a Sentinel upon them at Night; which the Iriſh perceiving, ſome of them came over the River in the Night in Cots, and burnt ſeveral of the Woolſacks, the Sentinel looking on, and alledging for an Excuſe, <hi>That he had no Orders to fire.</hi> The General gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to draw off the Guns from <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Fort, to ſome more convenient Place: But Colonel <hi>Wythers,</hi> Adjutant General, informing him what Execution ſome that were planted there did in the Town the Year before, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to continue firing, which they did to very good purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:99346:135"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Sept.</hi> 10. There was an Order for a Pinnace and its Crew to attend <hi>Francis Burton</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> who made ſeveral Journeys into the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> and had ſo ordered the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that Clare-Caſtle was to be delivered up to us, though for ſome Reaſons the General neglected the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity till it was included in the General Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the Morning one Capt. <hi>Dobbin,</hi> a Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, and Serjeant, deſert the Enemy, and told us, that the Bombs did great Execution in the Town, and had killed ſeveral: Our Guns fire very hard all that Day, and in the Evening a Bomb fell into a ſtore of Wine, Brandy, Oats and Bisket, ſpoiling a great part of it. The Town was alſo ſet on fire in ſeveral Places, which burnt great part of the Night: And that Evening two Mortars were brought from on Board, and planted at <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Fort, being managed by Lieutenant <hi>Brown,</hi> Lieutenant <note place="margin">Lieuten. <hi>Brown</hi> our beſt Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardeer.</note> to Capt. <hi>Pitts</hi> Miners, who did more Execution than all the reſt, firing three for one of theirs, and throwing the Bombs very exact; he neither made uſe of Sand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bomb, nor fired the Fuſe; but putting it into the Mortar with the Fuſe down, the Flaſh of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der kindled the Fuſe as it was diſcharged from the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. Colonel <hi>Wythers</hi> was ſent by Sea, and <hi>Robert Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> by Land, to haſten up our Fleet, which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood was at <hi>Cork,</hi> the General having ſome Accounts that the French deſigned to relieve the Town.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>11th</hi> the Breach was widened at leaſt forty Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and Floats being prepared, there were great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates amongſt the chief Officers whether it ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by Storm, (tho moſt ſay it was only deſigned at firſt for the more conveniency of battering the Town;) Deſerters telling us of a great Ditch without the Wall, always full of Water, and well palliſado'd, beſides ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Works within, which would have rendred the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:99346:135"/> very hazardous: but afterwards we found little Truth in this, though indeed we could not do the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my a greater Pleaſure, nor our ſelves a greater Prejudice in all Probability, than in ſeeking to carry the Town by a Breach, before thoſe within were more humbled, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Sword or Sickneſs: for we underſtood certainly that they had as many Men within as we without; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Hazard in getting into, or keeping the King's Iſland, where there ſtood a moſt excellent Fort with a double Line of Communication from thence to the Town, mann'd for the moſt part by the beſt of their Dragoons diſmounted. Part of the Guns however were drawn off from <hi>Ireton</hi>'s Fort to a new Battery, which was to the Right of the great one; and ſome planted nigh St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Iſland, to cut off the Iriſh Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note place="margin">Guns planted near St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>'s Iſland.</note> by a large Cauſey that led that way towards the Town. Five Deſerters came off, who tell us of ſome Officers killed upon the Key by a Bomb; that they had only two Tuns of Powder in Town, and that their Stores were a great part of them buried in Ruines. Some of Sir <hi>Albert Cunningham</hi>'s Officers gave the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral an Account from Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Ecklin,</hi> that Sir <hi>Albert</hi> was killed by a Party of the Iriſh at <hi>Colloony,</hi> nigh <hi>Sligoe,</hi> where they ſurprized him in the Morning early, moſt of his Dragoons ſhifting for themſelves; and <hi>Balderock O Donnel,</hi> who then had joined him, very hardly making his Eſcape: But the Engliſh Pacquets brought us better News of the Turkiſh Army's being defeated in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and a great many Thouſands ſlain.</p>
               <p>The <hi>12th</hi> moſt of our Guns and Bombs are directed <note place="margin">The Cannon and Bombs fire at the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral.</note> towards the great Church in the midſt of the Engliſh Town, becauſe we underſtood that it was made their principal Store; and four Deſerters tell us what great Damage was already done in all Places of the Town.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99346:136"/> But the Iriſh continuing obſtinate, and the indeavouring to reduce the Town by Force with ſuch a little Army as we had ſeeming dangerous, conſidering the very great Strength of their Works which were ſtill intire, though the Town was much ſhattered; thoſe and other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were like to render it a Work of longer time than at firſt we hoped for, and the Winter now drawing on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace; therefore Orders were given to fit up <hi>Killmallock</hi> for a Place of Stores. And,</p>
               <p>On the <hi>13th</hi> the General ſent Colonel <hi>Earl</hi> into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Col. <hi>Earl</hi> ſent into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </note> to acquaint her Majeſty with the preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Affairs; that if we ſhould not take the Town this Seaſon, it would be abſolutely neceſſary to ſend more Frigats, in order to block up the River <hi>Shannon,</hi> ſince Capt. <hi>Cole</hi> that commanded, and other Marine Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers then in the River, had given it under their Hands, that they could poſt twenty Frigats ſo advantageouſly towards the Mouth of the River, under ſome Iſlands, that they ſhould be able to live all Winter, and keep off twice the Number, if any Attempt ſhould be made by the French towards the Relief of the Town; and that in the mean time the Army was to make as nigh a Blockade as they could. This was but melancholy News to both Officers and Souldiers, who were all willing to undergo any Hardſhips rather than go away without being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>14th</hi> ſome Dragoons with an Officer deſert the Enemy; a Sergeant of theirs gave us notice where their Ammunition lay, and our Guns fire very hard all Day at the Place, the General and all the great Officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the whole Afternoon at the Battery, and were very well pleaſed to ſee a Bomb blow up ſome part of their Powder. At Night our Works were double mann'd, and our great Guns beginning to the right, the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99346:136"/> whole Line made three running Fires, which were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by as many from ſeveral Regiments both of Horſe and Foot, drawn up at the Heads of their reſpective Camps: this was for Joy of the Chriſtians Succeſs in <note place="margin">Guns fired for Joy the Turks were defeated in <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Hungary</hi> againſt the Turks; but it alarm'd the Iriſh, who ſtood at their Arms all the Night, being much puzzled to know the meaning of it; ſome ſaying that our Fleet had beat the French; and others, that it was only for a Blind at our going off; and every one as they fancied. Orders were now given for the demoliſhing <hi>Caſtle-connel, Carick a Gunnell,</hi> and other Places upon the <hi>Shannon;</hi> and ſeveral Miners were at work upon them.</p>
               <p>The fifteenth, the <hi>Finnan</hi> Regiment of <hi>Green Danes</hi> march towards <hi>Clonmell,</hi> in order to go to <hi>Waterford;</hi> and moſt of our Guns were drawn off from the Batteries as a Blind, to a Deſign at Night; being a great many Men at work all day to prepare our Tin-boats and Floats. That Afternoon my Lord <hi>Lisburn</hi> then upon Duty with his Regiment, to the Left of the Great Battery, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip having laid down to reſt him in a little Trench-Tent, juſt in the riſing up was unfortunately ſhot by a <note place="margin">My Lord <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> killed.</note> great Gun from one of the Enemies Batteries; being a Man of excellent Parts, and who had ſhewed himſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diligent and forward upon all Occaſions, ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this War.</p>
               <p>In the Evening it was ordered that four hundred Gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nadeers, <note place="margin">A Party order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to march o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the River.</note> ſo ſoon as 'twas dark, ſhould parade at the Head of Major General <hi>Kirk</hi>'s Regiment, from whence they marched about nine at Night, being joined with ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Workmen, with the Tin-boats, and ſuſtained with five Regiments of Foot commanded by Major General <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> and a Body of Horſe and Dragoons under Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General <hi>Scravemore,</hi> with ſix Field-pieces. Thoſe all march to a Place of the <hi>Shannon</hi> about two Miles above
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:99346:137"/> our Camp, and by twelve at Night begin to lay the Boats over. In the mean time the Granadeers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Sir <hi>David Collier,</hi> with Capt. <hi>Ketchmay</hi> of Sir <hi>John Hanmer</hi>'s, Captain <hi>Alnut</hi> of my Lord <hi>Drogheda</hi>'s, Captain <hi>Parker</hi> of Colonel <hi>Guſtavus Hamilton</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, another Captain, and eight more Officers, were wafted over by the Tin-boats into an Iſland where the Bridg was laying, and from whence it was fordable to the other ſide, beating ſome few Straglers of the Enemy from thence, who now and then fired at the Workmen, but with little or no Loſs to us; for the Night being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dark, and the Enemy ſecure, becauſe they judged us going off, the Bridg was almoſt compleated before they ſuſpected it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>16th</hi> at Day-light our Bridg was finiſhed; and <note place="margin">A Bridg laid, and our Men paſs over it.</note> Colonel <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Dragoons beginning to paſs into the Iſland: by which time Brigadeer <hi>Clifford</hi> had got the Alarm, who was not far off with four Regiments of Dragoons; he ſeemed not very forward in the Matter, tho his Dragoons came down on foot, and pretended to make ſome Oppoſition, as did alſo a Body of the Enemies Foot, being about four or five thin Regiments, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards the Ford, when Major General <hi>Talmaſh</hi> immediately commanded the Granadeers to wade thrô: which done, they poſſeſs'd themſelves of an old Houſe, and an Hedg or two, about an hundred Yards from the Enemy; and were commanded not to be laviſh of their Shot, but receive the Enemies Fire till our Dragoons and ſome Horſe were got over, which were paſſing. Then the Enemy endeavouring to flank our Granadeers on the Right, the Major General commanded a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Colonel <hi>Matthews</hi>'s Dragoons to beat them from that Poſt: which being done, and a good Party ſoon got over, Major General <hi>Talmaſh</hi> ordered the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadeers
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99346:137"/> to advance, being ſuſtained by a Regiment of Foot commanded by Colonel <hi>Tiffin</hi> and Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Briſtow,</hi> a Party of Dragoons, and a Party of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Coys</hi>'s Horſe. This was done; and after ſome faint Reſiſtance the Enemy run towards a large Bog, and a Wood that was in their Rear, throwing away their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes, Muskets, and every thing that proved trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom: our Men purſued them, and killed ſeveral upon the Bog, taking a French Lieutenant Colonel, a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſome more Priſoners. Our advance-Party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Orders to halt till all were got over, and then march'd to the Left up towards the Enemies Camp. But by this time the News of our paſſing the River was got to their Horſe, and alſo towards the Town, both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties providing for their Safeties as well as they could: for the People that were encamp'd without, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get into Town; but thoſe within drew up the Bridg, and would not admit them; and it's almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible what a Noiſe and Confuſion there was then at <hi>Thoumond</hi> Gate: their Horſe tho begin to buckle to Arms, and made a ſhew of fighting, which was only to gain time to ſecure their Tents and Baggage; and their Dragoons having their Horſes two Miles off at Graſs, were forced to ſhift for themſelves. Our Horſe expected Orders to purſue them; but they were commanded by the General and Lieut. Gen. <hi>Scravemore,</hi> who were now come up, to halt till a greater Body advanced to ſuſtain them. Some of the Iriſh were now pulling down their <note place="margin">The Iriſh in a great Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> Tents, others driving away the Cattle, and every one in a Hurry making what haſte they could towards the Mountains; and then the General ordered our Men to advance towards their Horſe-Camp, where they found Brandy, Beef, and a great many other things: And a Party of our Granadeers met with about three hundred
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99346:138"/> Dragoon Saddles and other Accoutrements, which they burnt by Order. We did not purſue however for fear of an Ambuſcade, but ſent to obſerve the Enemies March. The Iriſh alſo nigh the Town were very buſy in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down two ſmall Bridges croſs a Cauſey, leading to the Town; but the firing of two of our Field-pieces put a ſtop to their Proceedings in that Place. There is a ſmall white Houſe about half a Mile from the Town on <hi>Thoumond</hi> ſide, nigh which two Squadrons of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horſe were drawn up, and about a Regiment of Foot poſted in the Hedges, to ſecure their Lords Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Records, all their chief Ladies and Treaſure, which all were there, and had been as then no difficult, though a very good Prize. But after ſome of our Parties had ſeen them go off in the greateſt Confuſion that could be, we ſet two or three Houſes on fire: and ſtaying on that ſide till about two a Clock in the Afternoon, we had Orders to return, leaving a Guard in a Fort newly caſt up on the other ſide, to ſecure our Bridg; whenas it's not improbable, had we purſued our good Fortune, the Iriſh Horſe had been routed, and the Town deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon our own Terms.</p>
               <p>The Iriſh had ſtill a ſmall Gariſon in S. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Iſland, which now ſubmitted, where we got two pretty ſmall Braſs Field-pieces. There was alſo an Enſign with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men in a Caſtle, in the midſt of the River, a little below the Iſland, who were made Priſoners: This is <note place="margin">The Caſtle on the <hi>Wier</hi> taken.</note> called the <hi>Wier</hi> Caſtle, becauſe it ſtands on a <hi>Salmon Wier.</hi> In the former Wars the Iriſh had a Gariſon here alſo, who deſerting the Place, betook themſelves to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: but being ſhot at, part of them came on ſhoar to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Weſt, who had Quarter promiſed them by a Captain in Colonel <hi>Tuthill</hi>'s Regiment, and yet were ſtripp'd and killed by the Colonel's Orders, who was
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99346:138"/> tried and caſhiered for it; but the reſt coming a-ſhore on the Eaſt, where Colonel <hi>Inglesby</hi> was, had better Treatment, and ſent to the Town, <hi>Ireton</hi> being very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at the others Breach of Faith.</p>
               <p>We had only one Serjeant killed in all this Day's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and about twenty Men wounded, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my loſt not above fifteen or twenty at moſt. One Capt. <hi>Taaf</hi> in the Iriſh Royal Regiment deſerts, and ſays the Beſieged had not above ten Days Bread, and that our Bombs had deſtroyed a great part of their Ammunition. And that nothing might be left unattempted, to ſhew their Majeſties Clemency, the Government's Lenity, and the General's generous Compaſſion towards the Iriſh, he orders the following Declaration to be ſent them.</p>

               <p>On the <hi>17th</hi> a Council of War was held, wherein it <note place="margin">Diſputed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Siege continued, or a Blockade.</note> was hotly diſputed, whether we ſhould go on with the Siege, or march over the River and deſtroy all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Forage in the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> and then make a Blockade; and it was ſo far carried for the latter, that an Engineer was ordered to go with a Guard towards <hi>Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallock,</hi> and fortify that Place: but before he got out of the Camp he was countermanded, and a great many Palliſado's were brought up to <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Fort, as if we intended to winter there: three hundred Cars with Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Bombs, and other Neceſſaries come to the Camp from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and our Guns play ſtill from the great Battery. Eleven of the Enemies Troopers deſert, and a Standard was brought in that was taken the Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and my Lord <hi>Lisburn</hi>'s Corps were ſent hence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Dublin,</hi> there to be interred. Our Bridg of Boats was this Evening removed towards St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Iſland, but being too ſhort, it was carried to another Place, where it had alſo the ſame Inconveniency.</p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:99346:139"/>
               <p> The <hi>18th,</hi> Orders were ſent to the Men of War and other Veſſels in the River, to ſet ſome Men on Shoar in the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> to deſtroy all the Forage they could meet with, ſince this was the time of Harveſt; and if we muſt needs remove, the General was reſolved to make the Iriſh Quarters as bare as poſſible; and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of our heavy Cannon were put on Ship-board.</p>
               <p>The <hi>19th</hi> it being reſolved to paſs the River with a Party, either to proſecute the Seige, or at leaſt to burn the Forage; a Battery was raiſed between <hi>Ireton</hi>'s Fort and the old Church, to flank the Iriſh in Caſe of a Sally from St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gate, it being reaſonable to expect one when part of our Army once paſs'd the River: and now our People were very buſy in lengthning our Bridg, which they found ſome Difficulty in fixing, becauſe the the Rains had ſwelled the River, and we had not Boats enough to reach over; but that Defect was ſupplied by ſome large Carts and Barrels that were induſtriouſly fixed next the Sides, and ſo the Work was compleated, a Guard being always on the other Side for its Security; and my Lord <hi>Lisburn</hi>'s and Colonel <hi>Creighton</hi>'s Foot were encamp'd by it on our ſide. This Afternoon four Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars were brought from the great Battery to <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Fort, that Place being judged the fitteſt for bombarding, ſince the whole Town lay in a Line from thence. Three Rapparees were alſo brought in by the Militia, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for murdering ſeveral of our Men as they ſtraggled from the Camp to dig Potatoes; one of them produced a Paſs, as being of my Lord <hi>Gallmoy</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe: but this was an uſual ſhift, for in a Day or two there being evident Proof againſt them, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by a Court-Martial; the General gave Orders that they ſhould be broke upon the Wheel; but being told that this way of Torture was againſt the Laws of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99346:140"/> 
                  <hi>England,</hi> they were firſt hanged, and then their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters diſperſed and hung upon the Hedges, on the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent High-ways to the Camp. That Evening the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was informed that the Enemy reſolved to make a Sally, and therefore moſt of our Horſe and Dragoons were ordered to remain ſadled all Night: And in caſe of an Alarm, the Commander in chief where it ſhould be <note place="margin">Orders in caſe of an Alarm.</note> given, was immediately to acquaint the General with it; upon which three Guns were to be fired from the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, to warn the Regiments: thoſe on the left were to defend the left Trench, <hi>Kirk</hi>'s, <hi>Earl</hi>'s, and <hi>Hales</hi>'s were to defend from the Place my Lord <hi>Lisburn</hi> was killed to the great Battery; the other five Regiments of that Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade were to defend from <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Fort to the Well; and thoſe Regiments of the Prince of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> and <hi>La Mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>'s Brigades were to draw up at the Head of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Camps, and there remain till further Orders: ſo that our Army being diſpoſed of on this manner, the Iriſh would have met with a very ſcurvy Welcome, if they had come at any time to viſit us, but they conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better of it, and ſo ſtaid at home.</p>
               <p>The <hi>20th</hi> moſt of the reſt of our heavy Canon were <note place="margin">Some of our Guns ſhipp'd.</note> drawn off, and ſent on Shipboard: Several Deſerters come in, and ſome of our Priſoners make their Eſcape through a Hole in the Goal, which our Cannon had made, and inform the General of the State of the Town, that it was not ſo very bad as ſome People made it, for unleſs we kept them in alſo on the other Side, we could not hope to carry it, which Story had been very often told.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>21ſt</hi> the General received an Expreſs with an Account of <hi>Sligoe</hi>'s being ſurrendred to the Earl of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard;</hi> and it being fully agreed to paſs the River next Day, and a probable Conſequence of that being that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99346:140"/> the Iriſh muſt needs then or never endeavour to attempt the forcing of our Works on this ſide, when they ſaw our Army divide; therefore it was ordered, that in caſe of an Alarm, there ſhould be a Signal given, which was by the lighting of a Torch upon a Pike at <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Fort; the Charge of which was committed to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the Quarter-Guard, and he ordered to be very vigilant; the Regiments being diſpoſed of for Defence as before. The Quartermaſters were alſo ordered to be be at Major General <hi>Tetteau</hi>'s by break of Day. And therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>September</hi> the 22<hi>d,</hi> the General himſelf, the Duke of <note place="margin">Our Men paſs the River a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time.</note> 
                  <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> Lieutenant General <hi>Scravemore,</hi> with all our Horſe and Dragoons commanded by Major General <hi>Ruvigny,</hi> (except Colonel <hi>Coys</hi>'s Horſe, and fifty out of each Regiment of Dragoons) with ten Regiments of Foot, (and fourteen Guns, <hi>viz.</hi> ten 3 Pounders, and four 12 Pounders) taking alſo ſeven Days Proviſion along, march'd over our Bridg of Boats into the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> leaving Major General <hi>Mackay</hi> and Major General <hi>Talmaſh</hi> to command on this ſide. All that Morning as our Horſe and Foot march'd by this ſide of the Town, the Enemy fired continually upon us from ſeveral Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but did us no great Injury. At twelve a Clock all our Men had paſſed the River; and about two, eighteen of Colonel <hi>Matthews</hi>'s Dragoons, being our advance-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were attack'd by a Party of the Enemy, who out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbred ours, and obliged us to retreat, till ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a greater Party, as was alſo the Enemy: and ſome ſmall Firings continued till about four, that our Foot came up, we advancing ſtill, and the Enemy retiring till they were got under their Cannon. Then all the Granadeers of our Party, commanded by Colonel <hi>Tiffin,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Hudſon,</hi> and Major <hi>Noble,</hi> ſuſtained
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:99346:141"/> by <hi>Kirk</hi>'s, <hi>Tiffin</hi>'s, <hi>St. John</hi>'s, and my Lord <hi>George Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>'s Regiments, were commanded to advance and attack the Works that cover <hi>Thoumond</hi> Bridg, being one Fort to the Right above Musket-ſhot from the Bridg, <note place="margin">The Attack at <hi>Thoumond</hi> Gate.</note> another on the Left ſomewhat nearer; beſides ſeveral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Fortifications of Stone-quarries and Gravel-pits, in all which the Enemy had poſted a Detachment out of eighteen Regiments, of about eight hundred Men. The Diſpute was pretty hot at firſt: and their Cannon play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the King's Caſtle, and two or three more Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, as alſo their ſmall Shot from the Walls, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack ſeemed very hazardous, and our Men ordered not to approach ſo nigh the Town as they afterwards did. However, the Iriſh being now preſſed upon by our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadeers, they quitted their firſt Poſts, and then were rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by another Detachment from the Town: but all this could not do their buſineſs, for our Granadeers were ſo very forward, and deſpiſed all Dangers to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that they put the whole Body to flight in deſpight of their Forts, Cannon, and all other Advantages, and purſued them ſo cloſe, that a French Major who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded at <hi>Thoumond</hi> Gate, fearing our Mens entring the Town with their own, he ordered the Draw-bridg to be pluck'd up, and left the whole Party to the Mercy of our Souldiers; thoſe that were behind, preſſing the others forward, and throwing them down over the Fall of the Draw-bridg: then the reſt cried out for Quarter, holding up their Handkerchiefs, and what elſe they could get: but before killing was over, they were laid on Heaps upon the Bridg higher than the Ledges of it; ſo that they were all either killed or taken, except about a hundred and twenty that got into Town before the Bridg was drawn up, and many of thoſe cut and ſlaſh'd to the purpoſe. The number of the Dead is ſaid to be <note place="margin">600 of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy killed.</note>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:99346:141"/> ſix hundred, amongſt whom we may reckon one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fifty four that were drowned in being forced o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Fall of the Draw-bridg, and reckoned afterwards caſt up upon the Shore. The Priſoners were Colonel <hi>James Skelton,</hi> (who died afterwards of his Wounds) Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Edmond Hurley,</hi> Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Francis Dempſey,</hi> Major <hi>Matthew French, John Nelvil</hi> Aid-Major of <hi>Limerick,</hi> beſides nine Captains, ſeven Lieutenants, ſix Serjeants, and ninety ſeven private Men; all whoſe Names I have, but they are not worth the while of writing down, or reading afterwards. We took alſo five Colours; and, as ſome ſay, three ſmall braſs Guns that were with a Party of their Horſe. And we loſt in this Action Lieutenant <hi>Starlin,</hi> with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five private Men, and had about threeſcore wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>One thing here remarkable is, that Colonel <hi>Skelton</hi>'s <note place="margin">A remarkable Paper.</note> Pockets being ſearch'd when he was taken Priſoner, the following Paper was found amongſt other things: The Paper it ſelf I have, and will not be anſwerable either for the Orthography or Senſe; however take an exact Copy of it. And firſt, ſomething like the faſhion of a Spear's Head, or a Wound as he calls it, being ſlovenly drawn upon Paper, the following Words were writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THis is the Meaſure of the Wounds of the Side of our Saviour Jeſus Christ, wich was brought from</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinoble <hi>to the Emperor</hi> Charmaine <hi>in a Coffin of Goulde, and is a most precious Relique, to the end that he or ſhe that carried the ſame about him, no Fire nor Water, no Wind, Tempeſt, Knaife, Launce or Sword, nor the Divil cannot hurt him; and the Woman with Child the day ſhe ſeeth the ſame Meaſure, ſhall not dey a ſudden Death, but ſhall</hi>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:99346:142"/> 
                     <hi>be delivered by—and if any Man carre the ſame about him with good Devotion, ſhall have the Honor and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey of his Enimy. The day that any doth read the ſam, or heard it read, ſhall not dey an evil Death.</hi> Amen.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Animis ſcriptoris in manu Saluatoris.</p>
               <p>I have more Charity for any in Colonel <hi>Skelton</hi>'s Poſt, than to believe that he could write this Paper himſelf; for whoever did, underſtood neither Engliſh nor Latin, nor yet Common Senſe. I therefore believe it the Hand-writing of ſome poor ignorant Iriſh Prieſt, and kept by Colonel <hi>Skelton</hi> either out of Ridicule, or poſſibly out of ſome Religious Deſign; ſince I have heard that they had a great many of thoſe Papers print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and kept amongſt them with a great deal of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and if we'll look amongſt them, we may find a great many Inſtances of the like nature, and altogether as great Abſurdities; for Colonel <hi>Skelton</hi> was no Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor could he well be fond of the Fopperies of that Nation. In the former Wars we have ſeveral Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſuch like Religious Papers found upon the Iriſh, with a great many Charms, and other ſuch like Stuff; particularly at the Battel of <hi>Knocknaclaſhy,</hi> the laſt of that Rebellion, and parallel to this in ſeveral Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: for amongſt other Charms taken at that time, this one is remarkable, <hi>viz. This is the Print of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Foot; and whoever wears it, and ſays twenty</hi> Ave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>ſhall be free from Gunſhot.</hi> Cox, <hi>p.</hi> 68.</p>
               <p>But this Digreſſion I'm afraid is ſcarce pardonable; and therefore when our Men had lodged themſelves within ten Yards of the Bridg, (notwithſtanding an high Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that ſtood near that End of the Bridg next to them)
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99346:142"/> the Iriſh being then cut off from all Communication with their Horſe, and deſpairing of Succours from <hi>France,</hi> they began ſoon to think upon giving up the Town: but it muſt needs be thought very unaccountable, that when they ſaw our Forces divide, and part of them indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to approach the Town on their Side, they ſhould not then have brought all their Army together, and given us Battel, rather than ſuffer the Town to be ſurrounded: nor could they have been ſo pinn'd up in the Town by us if they really had been beat, but that their Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons might have fought their way out again at ſome time when we had not been at our Arms; for there was no Forage left nigh the Town, and our Horſe could no more ſtay long near it, than theirs within it. But it's probable e're this time that they were grown jealous of one another, and a great many of them weary of the War it ſelf; and it's as probable that if their Horſe and Dragoons, after a brisk Trial of Skill, had been forced towards the Town, they had been ſerved the ſame ſauce by the French Major as their Foot were; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were wiſer, and kept at a good Diſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Six-mile-Bridg,</hi> and nigh <hi>Ennis,</hi> towards whom the General ſent a Party of our Horſe.</p>
               <p>Next Day, being Wedneſday the 23<hi>d,</hi> one hundred Cattle taken from the Enemy the Day before, and ſix hundred more ſent out of the County of <hi>Kerry</hi> by Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadeer <hi>Leveſon,</hi> were divided amongſt the Army. And though the Day proved very rainy, yet our Guns and ſome Mortars ceaſed not to play upon the Town, nor the Enemy to fire more furiouſly than they had done for ſome time before. One Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Corbet</hi> came off from the Enemy, and propoſed to the General the bringing over my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s and <hi>Galmoy</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horſe, and out of thoſe two to make one good
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99346:143"/> Regiment to ſerve their Majeſties in <hi>Flanders,</hi> provided he might have the Command of them. Towards Night the Rain begun to ceaſe, and both Storms were ended together, for about ſix a Clock the Enemy beat a Parly <note place="margin">The Enemy beat a Parly.</note> on both Sides the Town; one Colonel <hi>Ruth</hi> coming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Fort, where the Earl of <hi>Drogheda</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment then were upon Duty: But Major General <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſh</hi> ſhortly after coming that way, and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, he referred the Matter to Lieutenant General <hi>Scravemore,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>Ruvigny.</hi> The General being then beyond the River, Major General <hi>Waughup,</hi> or Lieutenant General <hi>Sarsfield</hi> went out to him, and a Ceſſation was concluded for that Night.</p>
               <p>The <hi>24th</hi> in the Morning, Lieutenant General <hi>Sarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A Ceſſation agreed to.</note> and Major General <hi>Waughup</hi> came out to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and deſired it might be continued for three Days longer, till they could ſend to their Horſe, who then were encamp'd towards <hi>Clare,</hi> in order to their being included in the general Capitulation which they then propoſed, and the Requeſt was granted. The Enemy had now in Town two hundred forty and odd Priſoners of our Army and Militia, that had been taken in the County of <hi>Cork,</hi> and other Places, who remained there all the Siege, and were pretty well look'd after whilſt the Proteſtants had leave to ſtay, who were inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly kind to them; but no ſooner were they turn'd out of Town, but the poor Priſoners were in a miſerable Condition, being expoſed to the Fury of our own Guns and Mortars, and about thirty of them killed during the Siege. This Afternoon thoſe alive were brought out to us, and delivered between <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Fort and the Town, many of them in a miſerable Condition; thoſe of them that were not able to walk, were brought out upon poor lean Garrons; and ſome died upon the Spot
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:99346:143"/> where they were ſet down, being weak, and unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the open Air: Nay ſo barbarous had the Iriſh been in this Particular, that they had not ſo much as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Wounds of ſome of our Men to be dreſſed that they had got in Priſon by our own Guns; but after ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Days keeping them in that Miſery, they brought them out, and made us all Witneſſes of their Barbarity: I give one Inſtance of a Dragoon in Colonel <hi>Matthews</hi>'s Regiment, who had his Hand ſhattered to Pieces, and being never dreſs'd, he died within an Hour after his bringing out. The ſame Day we had an Account that <hi>Galloping Hogan,</hi> a Fellow that had got upwards of one hundred Rapparees together, Horſe and Foot, and got much Plunder by robbing the Sutlers and other People, that came into his Power; he was now ſo bold as to ſet upon a Party of Carrs coming towards the Camp with little or no Guard, nigh <hi>Cullen,</hi> and took away with him ſeventy one ſmall Horſes, though he durſt not ſtay to do any further Miſchief.</p>

               <p> Theſe Propoſitions were very unreaſonable, and they ſay mightily inſiſted upon by <hi>Mack Guire</hi> and others of the Prieſthood: this Man I'm told was Chaplain to the Spaniſh Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Plunket</hi> the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Primate was hanged about the Popiſh Plot in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and few People daring to aſſume that Title at ſuch a Juncture, the Ambaſſador procured it from the Pope for him.

               <p>On the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> a Party of Rapparees near <hi>Tallough,</hi> rob ſome Carriages belonging to the Officers in the Princeſs <hi>Ann</hi>'s Regiment, and got away into the Woods.

But the Enemy ſeeing a great many Carriages with my Lord <hi>Granard</hi>'s Party, they were perſwaded that they had brought heavy Cannon, with Mortars, Bombs, Carcaſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that they beat another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and after ſome time they conſented to ſurrender the <note place="margin">

               <p>The Fort was ſurrendred on the ſixteenth, being made of Turf, and having in it ſix hundred Men and ſixteen Guns; and Colonel <hi>Mitchelburn</hi> was left Governour.

Captain <hi>Orfeur</hi> of Colonel <hi>Haſtings</hi>'s Regiment, going out with a Party of the ſaid Regiment, and ſome of the Militia, he killed twenty of the Rapparees near <hi>Liſmore,</hi> which ſo terrified the reſt, that the Countrey thereabouts was pretty quiet for ſome time.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>August John Mackabe,</hi> the notorious Rapparee, who ſo much infeſted the Bog of <hi>Allen,</hi> was brought with four of his Companions, by Lieutenant <hi>Sheilds</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Courtney,</hi> to <hi>Dublin;</hi> and on the <hi>19th</hi> they were hanged up in Chains at the <hi>Naas:</hi> This Fellow, and another called the White Serjeant, had been both in the Iriſh Army, but broke there for ſome Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueries; and after a great deal of Miſchief done to the Countrey, they both got what they deſerved, the one being killed, and the other hanged. About this time one of the Militia was killed, and ſeveral wounded by the Rapparees near <hi>Caperquin;</hi> but in requital the Militia kill five of them.</p>
               <p>Towards the latter End of <hi>September,</hi> two Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the Iriſh Army having deſerted, and got our General's Paſs to go home, they were met withal by <hi>Hogan</hi> and his Party, and ſtripp'd of what they had; but neither himſelf nor any of his Crew could read the Paſs, elſe it's probable they would have ſent them the way they ſometimes did our Militia, when they fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Power. Two Rapparees of one <hi>Higgins</hi>'s Party are taken; and himſelf deſires a Protection. Six more are killed near <hi>Mountmelick.</hi> And on the <hi>26th</hi> one <hi>Calog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> a great Rapparee, and ſome of his Party, come in under Protection at <hi>Edenderry:</hi> for now they began to

                     <hi>October,</hi> 1691.</note> therefore when they were afraid to loſe the Power of doing Miſchief, they came in, and not before.</p>
               <p>And to conclude the Month, <hi>Hogan</hi> and his Party meeting with ſome of our Militia Dragoons near <hi>Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creagh,</hi> murder ſeven of them, and the eighth hardly eſcaped. One <hi>Tiercy</hi> was ſeized and hanged: And one <hi>Purcell,</hi> after the Rope had broke with him, promiſing to make a Diſcovery, was ſaved, and detected four more. And nigh the End of this Month our Packets brought us an account of the Death of Lieutenant General <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> in <hi>Flanders.</hi>

And whilſt they were at this Work, the General was ſettling the Quarters of ſeveral of our own Regiments, who now had endured a very long and active Campaigne.</p>

               <p> The Sixth in the Morning a Sermon was preached to each <hi>Iriſh</hi> Regiment by their Prieſts, declaring the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to them and their Religion, by adhering to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and the Inconveniences, nay, certain Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, of joining with Hereticks; and then a good Quantity of Brandy given them to waſh it down.

                  <hi>Clare-ſide,</hi> being at leaſt Fourteen thouſand Men by Poll. The Lords-Juſtices and General went over the River to view them, Adjutant-General <hi>Wythers</hi> being appointed to acquaint them with the Advantages of our Service above that of <hi>France;</hi> and how unnatural it was for them to chuſe to go ſerve in a Foreign Countrey againſt the real Intereſt of their own, with much more to that purpoſe, and Care was likewiſe taken to diſtribute the General's Declaration. Then the Regiments were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to march, and thoſe that were for <hi>France,</hi> went on; but thoſe that were inclined to us, had liberty to file off at a Place appointed. That which they called the Royal Regiment, being then fourteen hundred Men, ſeem'd to go all entire except ſeven Men, which the General was much concerned at; then my Lord <hi>Ivaeghe</hi>'s Regiment of <hi>

                  </note> their ſide, they returned towards <hi>Dublin;</hi> and Colonel <hi>Earles,</hi> with a Regiment of <hi>Danes,</hi> march towards Quarters. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> had kept their Stores pretty entire, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Capitulation till after the Diviſion of Men; and then they diſtribute Bread, Brandy, Claret, and ſome little Money amongſt thoſe that ſtaid with them, as well to
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:99346:159"/> encourage ſome, as to prevent others from going off, keeping their Gates always faſt lock'd, and a ſtrong Guard at each. And now the General ſeem'd diſpleaſed that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> uſed indirect means to threaten their Men into a <hi>French</hi> Voyage, telling the <hi>Iriſh</hi> great Officers plainly, that if they broke the Articles, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no longer obliged to obſerve them; then Colonel <hi>Matthews,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Lumley</hi> were ſent to the Horſe-Camp upon the ſame account: And this day, and the next, my Lord <hi>Ivaeghe</hi>'s, Colonel <hi>Wilſon</hi>'s, part of my Lord <hi>Dillon</hi>'s, Colonel <hi>Huſſey</hi>'s, and other <hi>Iriſh</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were muſtered nigh the General's Quarters, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king 1046 in thoſe two days, beſide double the number that had Paſſes to go home; thoſe that were muſtered had all of them Bread, Cheeſe, Brandy, and Tabaco, with a Fortnight's Subſiſtence given them by Adjutant-General <hi>Wythers,</hi> who never can be ſufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for the Care and Pains he has taken during the whole War of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The General was reſolved to do all things poſſible to prevent the <hi>Iriſh</hi> going in ſo great Numbers out of the Kingdom, as being a ſtrengthning our Adverſaries, and a weakning of our ſelves; and therefore he orders the following Declaration to be Publiſhed.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ANd now the Campaign being ended, ſo that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Thread of Affairs can be drawn from the Army, any thing that has happen'd ſince may poſſibly not be ſo acceptable; yet I hope it may not be amiſs to
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99346:163"/> give you ſome ſlender account how things have gone in that Kingdom ſince the Siege of <hi>Limerick</hi> to the time of the Proclamation for the War's being ended; though, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed further, it will be neceſſary to look back, and bring the Actions done in ſeveral other parts of the Kingdom, up to the Armies removing from <hi>Limerick;</hi> which indeed may be told in few Words, ſince little of moment cou'd be expected in any other place, but where the Seat of War was fixed.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> Sollicitor-General <hi>Levinge,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Reves,</hi> being appointed Judges for the <hi>Connaught-Circuit;</hi> becauſe the Countrey was very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently inhabited, and not as yet throughly ſettled, Aſſizes were appointed to be held for this Province, only at <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingar, Roſcommon,</hi> and <hi>Galway,</hi> which was done according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: About 20 Rapparees were killed in the Counties of <hi>Waterford</hi> and <hi>Cork,</hi> by ſome ſmall Parties of the <hi>Militia;</hi> and one <hi>Whitney,</hi> with 4 more in his Company, were ſet upon, and murdered by a Party of Rapparees, as they were going towards the Queen's County, though they killed two, and wounded others before they were ſeized. And now thoſe looſe Fellows ſeeing how it was like to go with their Party, ſeveral of them come in under Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and deſire to ſerve their Majeſties abroad, when they were out of hopes to plunder their Subjects any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at home.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Priſoners of War that were in <hi>Waterford-Gaol,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iriſh</hi> Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of War releaſed.</note> being upwards of 200, were ſet at liberty, as they were afterwards at ſeveral other Places; particularly at <hi>Carigfergus,</hi> where 15 Officers, and about 60 private Men had been Priſoners, ever ſince the Rout at <hi>Cavan:</hi> and at <hi>Lambay,</hi> where the Priſoners, taken at <hi>Ballymore,</hi> were kept moſt of this Summer; but now were all diſcharged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Capitulation.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:99346:163"/>
               <p> And as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> grew weary of their former Courſes on that ſide of the Country towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> (or rather being forced to it when they could no longer carry it on,) ſo they ſubmitted apace in all the Corners of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. On the <hi>14th,</hi> one whom they termed Colonel <note place="margin">Some Rappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rees lay down thei Arms.</note> 
                  <hi>Burk,</hi> a popular Man amongſt the Rapparees, with a great many of his Followers, came in and ſubmitted at <hi>Lough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> in the County of <hi>Galway.</hi> On the ſame Day the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Horſe, and ſome Foot, March from <hi>Caſhell</hi> towards <hi>Cork,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Heſſe</hi> going along, as well to prevent the <hi>Iriſh</hi> from plundering the Countrey, as to hinder any little Quarrels that might happen between them and our own Men as they met accidentally upon the March.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>14th</hi> Two Proclamations were Publiſhed by the <note place="margin">Proclamations of Pardon to the reſt.</note> Lords Juſtices and Council, one reciting a former Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Dated the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> promiſing Pardon and Protection to all Robbers, Thieves, and Rapparees, who within a Month ſhould ſurrender up their Arms to any Juſtice of the Peace, and take the Oath of Fidelity to Their Majeſties mentioned in the Articles of <hi>Limerick,</hi> requiring the Juſtices of the Peace to make a return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Hands, of their Names, places of Abode, their Qualities, and Arms, but forbidding all protected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and others, to relieve, conceal, or harbour, the ſaid Robbers, who would not ſubmit; upon pain of forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own Protections, and being proſecuted with the utmoſt ſeverity of Law for ſuch offence: Promiſing alſo a Reward of Forty Shillings to any one that would bring in the heads of any ſuch Rogues as would not lay hold on this fair opportunity. By this Proclamation the time for their coming in was protracted till the Fifth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:99346:164"/>
               <p> The other Proclamation was to forbid all Officers and Souldiers of the Army, or others, to do any harm or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to any of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or make any diſtinction of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, every one that takes the Oath, to be eſteemed a Subject, and equally entitled to the Benefit of Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Laws with the reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which means all things became ſo Calm on a ſudden, as if there had been no Storm at all in that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Our Army are now on their March to their reſpective Winter Quarters, and thoſe of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that came over to us had Subſiſtence and Quarters aſſigned them till Their Majeſties pleaſure was further known.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>19th, Hogan,</hi> and moſt of his Crew, came in at <hi>Roſcreagh,</hi> and had the benefit of the Proclamation, being afterwards allow'd Twenty Four Men by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to ſuppreſs other Rapparees upon occaſion, tho' this was fatal to him, for ſome of that ſort of People Murdered him afterwards. All the Roads and other places leading <note place="margin">The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter Iriſh</hi> return home with their Cattle.</note> from the Counties of <hi>Kerry</hi> and <hi>Clare</hi> towards the North, are now full of nothing but <hi>Creights,</hi> and vaſt ſtocks of Cattle driving homewards, which was a little odd to ſee, that they would rather hazzard the loſs of their Cattle by a long March into <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> where they had formerly robb'd and plundered the Proteſtants, and were like to be called to an Account for it, at leaſt they could expect no great encouragement in thoſe places for the future, nor any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of their being received as Tenants to their old Farms at their return thither: One would have thought, I ſay, theſe things conſidered, that they would rather have endeavoured to ſtay in the Counties of <hi>Kerry, Clare,</hi> and <hi>Limerick,</hi> where there was Land enough for them, and at eaſie Rates, than to run all hazards by going down into the North; but the reaſon of this is plain, for there is ſo
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:99346:164"/> great an Antipathy between the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lster Iriſh,</hi> and thoſe in other parts of the Kingdom, as nothing can be more, and the Feuds amongſt them greater than between either, and their injured Proteſtant Neighbours, whoſe favour they had hopes of gaining ſooner, than the friendſhip of one another, neither Party truſting other, or ever deſiring it to be otherways; my Lord <hi>Merion,</hi> Brigadeer <hi>Clifford,</hi> Colonel <hi>Henry Lutterill,</hi> Baron <hi>Purcell,</hi> and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nobility and Gentry go towards <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Articles of <hi>Limerick</hi> you may ſee, that the <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Fleet arrives in the <hi>Shannon.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>French</hi> General Officers expected the coming of their Fleet, and what was only a report before, is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that they really did come, being Eighteen Men of War, Four Fireſhips, and Twenty Ships of Burden, under Monſieur <hi>Shalterneau,</hi> of which Monſieur <hi>D'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſone</hi> gives notice to Major General <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> and it was agreed to keep a friendly Correſpondence till all matters relating to the Articles were ſettled.

                     <p>SInce the Letter I ſent you laſt Night, I find it more <note place="margin">To Sir <hi>Ralph Delaval.</hi>
                        </note> and more neceſſary that your Squadron ſhould come round to the <hi>Shannon,</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> Generals make ſo many difficulties ſince the coming of their Fleet, that they ſeem to deſign nothing but delaying of time: I muſt therefore again preſs you to Sail to the River as ſoon as poſſible, and place your ſelf ſo, that Captain <hi>Coale</hi> and the Ships he has with him may join you, to the end, that if the <hi>French</hi> break the Articles we have made, we may be in a Condition to do our ſelves right. I am informed there are ſeveral Frigats at <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,</hi> which you'll pleaſe to make uſe of if you think you ſhall have occaſion for them. The <hi>French</hi> Fleet is now at <hi>Scatterey.</hi>

               <p>But whether the Wind would not ſerve our Fleet's, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming about to the <hi>Shannon,</hi> or what other reaſons there might be, I am a ſtranger to, tho' all that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers inſiſted on after the coming of their Fleet, was only to have a <hi>Clauſe</hi> confirmed that was caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally omitted in the Articles which the General promiſed them, and Their Majeſties were pleaſed afterwards to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to.</p>
               <p>For it being late at Night when the Articles were agreed to, and they Engroſſed in haſte this Clauſe, <hi>And all ſuch as are under their protection in the ſaid Counties,</hi> was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Engroſſer, tho' it was certainly inſerted in the foul Draught. This was what the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red might be made good after the coming of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet: And firſt it was but reaſonable, ſeeing it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the intent of the Articles. Secondly, It was Prudence not to deny it, ſince the <hi>French</hi> Fleet being Eighteen Men
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:99346:165"/> of War, Four Fireſhips, and Twenty Ships of Burden were certainly too hard for Captain <hi>Coal</hi> and his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron then in the <hi>Shannon,</hi> and might have put what Men and Proviſions they pleaſed into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Town, our Army alſo being gone to Quarters, we had only Five Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Town, with my Lord <hi>Drogheda</hi>'s, and my Lord <hi>Lisburn</hi>'s, Encamp'd without the Walls. Proviſions alſo were ſo ſcarce with us, that our Men had only a Pint of Meal a Day allowed them, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in the other Town were not only more in number, but better provided, ſo that if Juſtice could not have obliged the General to the Confirmation of that <hi>Clauſe,</hi> yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion at that Juncture would.</p>
               <p>In a Day or Two after the Articles were Signed, we had News that the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was come to <hi>Dingle Bay,</hi> with Ammunition and all ſorts of Proviſions for the Relief of the Town, this made the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Great Officers hang their Heads, to think they ſhould ſo eaſily part with a place of that importance, or rather, how they could Anſwer it to the <hi>French</hi> King, who had been at all that expence and hazard in order to their Relief, but the opportunity was loſt in doing it no ſooner, which ſome have look'd upon ſince as one of the falſeſt ſteps made in <hi>France</hi> of a long time, our King being now at leiſure to viſit them, inſtead of their ſupporting his Enemies in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And tho' the <hi>French</hi> Fleet came too late to Relieve the <note place="margin">Some Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Articles of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> Town, yet I hope it may not be impertinent to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Anſwering ſome Objections that have been ſince made againſt the Capitulations of <hi>Limerick:</hi> As if the Lords Juſtices and the General had condeſcended too far in granting the <hi>Iriſh</hi> any Terms at all, at leaſt ſuch as they did, which put them into a Condition of Revolting again whenſoever an opportunity offered it ſelf. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Providence ſeem'd now to have given the <hi>Iriſh</hi> up, as the Barbarous Nations were formerly to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:99346:166"/> that if this occaſion was neglected, of putting it out of their power for ever hereafter to endanger the <hi>Engliſh</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: Or if it was not made a right uſe of, (by which they underſtood deſtroying of them Root and Branch,) then we might certainly expect, that all the Expence and Blood it has coſt <hi>England</hi> in their Reduction, will in a ſmall time ſignifie nothing; ſince it's obſerved, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> of themſelves are a ſloathful People, naturally inclined to Spoil, Rapine, Stealth, and Oppreſſion, bred in no Trades, Manufactures, or other ways of Civil Induſtry, to live by in times of Peace, wherein they never did, nor can endure to continue long, loving always a ſavage and unbridled kind of Life: And therefore when one oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is neglected of deſtroying them, it will be the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God to make them afterwards the Inſtruments of our puniſhment, as they have been hitherto. And thus Argue a great many People of that Countrey, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend good experience, and that very lately, for what they ſay.</p>
               <p>But as to thoſe Compariſons between us and the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and the Barbarous Nations formerly Inhabiting <hi>Judea,</hi> there can be no juſt proportion made to draw any reaſonable Concluſions from, ſince the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as well as we, tho' miſled and abuſed in a great many points, and have a natural right to their Countrey, which ſeveral of them have never forfeited by any Rebellions, how forward ſoever others may have been. And for my own part I muſt own my ſelf of the Opinion, that any Policy that is founded in Blood, and tends to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Mankind, is not ſo warrantable by the Law of God, as ſome people endeavour to make it, excepting that one Inſtance of the <hi>Jews</hi> which is no precedent to any other People: And what means ſoever may be uſed for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of Unity, or Settlement, in a Countrey, Men muſt at the ſame time be careful not to deface and diſſolve
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:99346:166"/> the Bonds of Chriſtian Charity; nay, of humane Society, ſince acting the contrary, is but to daſh the ſecond Table againſt the firſt; and ſo to conſider others as of this or that Perſuaſion, and treat them ill upon that account, is to forget that they are Men (as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> has former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved;) And indeed to me it ſeems full as unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to deſtroy other People, purely becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think as we do, as it is for one man to ruine another, becauſe the outward Figure and Shape of his Body is not the ſame with his own.</p>
               <p>Nor can I imagine that the deſtruction of thoſe men, if they really had been in our power, could any way have contributed either to the profit or further advancement of the Intereſt of that Country, ſince the Act of Settlement of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> upon their preſent Majeſties, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deliberately provides, <hi>That no Papiſt, or any one marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Papiſt, ſhall for ever hereafter be capable to inherit the Imperial Crowns of theſe Kingdoms.</hi> And the late ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Act relating to <hi>Ireland,</hi> entituled, <hi>An Act for abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and appointing other new ones,</hi> are both very conſiderable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to the Proteſtant Intereſt in that Kingdom; and no doubt, it will be eaſier for the Government to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and keep their part of thoſe Articles, than for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelves to do their duty; which will be ſeen in time; and there are other convenient Maxims to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; which, being things out of my way, I do not pretend to conſider them; what I have to offer upon this Head, being rather Matter of Fact than Argument, and that by comparing the ſtate of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> at <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and other Places of the Kingdom, at the making of theſe Articles; with their Condition at their ſurrendring up all in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wars.</p>
               <p>In the former Wars of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the City of <hi>Lymerick</hi> was ſurrendered to <hi>Ireton</hi> on the 29th. of <hi>October</hi> 1651,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:99346:167"/> upon ſevere Articles; the Governour, the Titular Biſhop of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> and twelve more being excepted by name, and ſome of theſe were afterwards executed; but during the Siege, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> loſt 5000 men, of whom the Plague deſtroyed many more than the Sword; 1300 only march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and about 4000 <hi>Iriſh</hi> remained within. <hi>Cox, Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 69.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Galway</hi> was ſurrendered on the 12th. of <hi>May</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to Sir <hi>Charles Coot;</hi> and on the 27th. of <hi>June,</hi> Major General <hi>Ludlow</hi> frighted the Garriſon of <hi>Roſs</hi> in <hi>Kerry,</hi> into a Surrender, by a ſmall Veſſel that he was bringing over the Hills to put into the Lough that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds Roſs-Caſtle. <hi>Roſscommon</hi> and <hi>James-Town</hi> had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred to Col. <hi>Reynolds</hi> on the 27th. of <hi>April</hi> before, and <hi>Inchylough</hi> ſurrendred to Col. <hi>Zanchy</hi> on the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at what time the Lords of <hi>Westmeath</hi> and <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery, O Connor Roe,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Talbot,</hi> Sir <hi>William Dungan,</hi> and, ſeveral others ſubmitted upon thoſe Conditions, <hi>That they ſhould abide a Trial for the Murders committed in the beginning of the Rebellion, and thoſe that only aſſiſted in the War, were to forfeit two Thirds of their Eſtates, and to be baniſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what I would further obſerve, is this, That when the General Aſſembly of the Popiſh Clergy, and others, at <hi>Loughreagh,</hi> deſired the then Marqueſs of <hi>Ormend</hi>'s leave to treat with the Enemy for the Nation in general, at the Surrender of <hi>Galway, Cromwel</hi>'s Army poſitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it; being reſolved not to admit of any Treaty for the whole; but thoſe that would capitulate, ſhould do it only for themſelves, or the Towns and Places they reſpectively belonged to: By which means tho' the Town of <hi>Galway</hi> was the laſt conſiderable one that was ſurrendered; being on the 12th. of <hi>May</hi> 1652. yet it was the 26th. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 1653. before it was declared <hi>That the Rebels were ſubdued, and the Rebellion appeaſed and ended.</hi> And
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:99346:167"/> though His Majeſties Proclamation about the ending of this preſent War, was nigh ſix Months after the Surrender of <hi>Lymerick,</hi> yet this was deferred, only with reſpect to the poverty of the Country, in forgiving the Kingdom half a years Quit-Rents, and had not the leaſt relation to any appearance of a further Diſturbance, as appears by the Proclamation it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now if <hi>Lymerick</hi> had been no ſtronger Town when we laſt beſieged it, than it was ſome time after the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> when Earl <hi>Reymond,</hi> Son-in-Law to <hi>Strongbow,</hi> and General of the Army, with <hi>David Walſh,</hi> and others, ſwam into the King's Iſland; who taking the City (without any ſort of Cannon) and plundering it, they left a Garriſon of their own men there; or indeed if it had been in no better condition than in the former Wars, when there appeared nothing like Works without the Walls themſelves; or if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> People were no better skill'd in Arms now, than they have been heretofore, even in the late times, being moſt of them rather a confuſed Rabble, than any thing that deſerved the Name of an Army; then it had been a Reflection upon an Army ſo well diſciplin'd, and in ſo good order as ours was, not to have humbled them without any Terms: But beſides the natural ſtrength of its Situation, <hi>Lymerick</hi> is now impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Art to that degree, that it is very much ſtronger than it was when we laid Siege to it the former year, the Enemy with extraordinary diligence and induſtry having ſince that, caſt up very ſtrong new Works round the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Town with great Improvements in the King's Iſland, and elſewhere. And the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had not only the Advantages of being train'd up to the uſe of Arms by my Lord <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel,</hi> and ſerving in an Army for ſome years paſt, but ſeveral of them have been abroad in foreign Service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the being for the moſt part in Action during the three Campagnes in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and Cuſtom it ſelf, is, no doubt
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:99346:168"/> of it, one Point of Courage. But thoſe who ever read the Story of <hi>Noteburg,</hi> will not wonder at this Capitulation; this (they ſay) is a Town built in an Iſland at the Entrance of the Lake <hi>Lagoda,</hi> made by the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and encompaſſed with a ſtrong W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> it muſt needs be acknowledged that they never had formerly ſo fair a Pretext as now; nor had they ever been ſo unanimous (ſince in the late Wars they had at leaſt three different Armies on Foot at the ſame time) they had now alſo the Aſſiſtance and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of <hi>France,</hi> which is without queſtion at preſent one of the moſt powerful Intereſts in the World; and if they had held out till the following Winter, they muſt needs have much fatigued our Army, by continual Alarms and Watchings, beſides other Difficulties that would have attended us in a Blockade, in which there's no ſubſiſting without continual Supplies of Money, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and Victuals; and eſpecially near ſuch a place as <hi>Limerick</hi> then was, the Countrey thereabouts being ruined and exhauſted in continuing the Seat of War for two Campaigns; ſo that abſtracting from the deepneſs of the Soil, and the ſharpneſs of the Winter, as it afterwards proved, unleſs we had been full as carefully ſupplied with Neceſſaries as ever we had been formerly, the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign had been ſtill in hazard, beſides the loſs of Time and Treaſure.</p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:99346:168"/>
               <p> And though we had paſſed the River; yet we were ſtill as far from entring the Town as ever. What might have been done ſome time before, I am no competent Judge of; but ſince the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had it ſtill in their Power to give us the Town, or keep it to themſelves, I ſee no Reaſon why they ought not to make a Bargain for it, and expect the performance of their Contract, which Their Majeſties have been graciouſly pleaſed to ratifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great Seal of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may rationally be here demanded, why the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would treat with us for the Town, ſince they had full as many Foot within as we had in our Army without; and and notwithſtanding all the Stories told us by Deſerters about the ſcarcity of Proviſions, they had a quantity of the fineſt <hi>French</hi> Bisket I ever taſted, ſufficient for the whole Garriſon for two Months; ſome of which I ſaw; and Commiſſary-General <hi>Aſpole</hi> aſſured my ſelf and ſome other Friends, that they had the reſt: Upon which I asked him the reaſon of giving us the Town? And his Reply was, That if they had been driven by neceſſity to yield, they muſt then have accepted what Terms we had pleaſed to give them; but ſince they were not, they had ſtood upon ſuch as were for the Advantage of their whole Party. But the Truth of it is, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were either weary of the War, or jealous of one another, or it may be both; it being no ill Policy on our ſide to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their differences, and make their private Quarrels advance our Publick Service. And as for what happen'd at this Juncture, it's certain that the <hi>French</hi> Lieutenant-Generals were jealous of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> betraying, or, at leaſt, forſaking them: And 'tis without queſtion they uſed their Intereſt, in perſuading the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to hold out till Relief came; for they knew, conſidering all things, it had been very improper for us to endeavour the forcing the Town by a Breach. But I imagine Monſieur <hi>D'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſone</hi>'s Caſe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:99346:169"/> now was much the ſame, as that of <hi>Don John de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila</hi> at <hi>Kinſale,</hi> in the Year, 1601. who finding the Town was like to be loſt; and that inſtead of conquering a Kingdom, his Men and himſelf were like to become a Prey to the Enemy: He then deſires a parley with the Lord-Deputy, wherein he mentions, that having found his Lordſhip, though a ſharp and powerful Antagoniſt, yet an honourable and generous Enemy; and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> not only weak and barbarous, but (as he feared) perfidious Friends, he therefore deſired to depart upon ſuch Terms, befitting ſuch Men of War, as are not by neceſſity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to receive Conditions, but willingly induced for juſt Reſpects to diſengage themſelves, and to relinquiſh a People by whom their King and Maſter had been ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly abuſed, if not betray'd. <hi>Pacata Hib. p.</hi> 241. And its probable, that upon ſome ſuch Motives as thoſe, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>D'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſone</hi> conſented to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Capitulations, though we heard afterwards that the <hi>French</hi> King was ſo far from thanking him for it, that after ſome publick <hi>Indignities</hi> he ſent him to the <hi>Baſtile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I humbly therefore am of Opinion, that the Lords-Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices and the General did nothing in this Affair without Command, or, at leaſt, Inſtructions from Their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties; and that it was neither inconſiſtent with the Rules of Prudence or Policy, to grant the <hi>Iriſh</hi> what Terms they did, which for the future may help to moderate the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſome ſort of People.</p>
               <p>Nor were the Lords-Juſtices Proclamations for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the Rapparees and others, not included in the Articles leſs ſeaſonable, ſince by this means the Kingdom became ſo calm and quiet all on a ſudden, that within one Fortnight after our Army was removed from <hi>Limerick,</hi> a Man might have travelled alone through that whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that with as great Safety as through any part of <hi>England;</hi> but if this had been delayed, and the reducing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:99346:169"/> thoſe Scamperers attempted altogether by force, pray let it be remembred how ſecurely the <hi>Banditto</hi>'s of <hi>Italy</hi> have <note place="margin">
                     <hi>November</hi> 1691.</note> lived between the Power of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that of the Pope, and how many Men in all Countries have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered in doing miſchief; but eſpecially in <hi>Ireland</hi> where there are ſo many Difficulties to march an Army, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſo well acquainted with the Boggs and other Faſtneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that it is impoſſible to beat them ſooner out of one place than they'll out-ſtrip you to another, being by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice extremely well skilled in making uſe of thoſe Advantages; but the aforeſaid Articles, and Proclamations have remedied all thoſe Inconveniences, and that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom never enjoyed a more profound Peace than at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſince every Inſurrection when it is ſubdued, makes an Addition to the Power of the Government.</p>
               <p>But I'm afraid a good Cauſe may ſuffer by ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore as to my buſineſs. Towards the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of <hi>October,</hi> we had an Account of his Majeſty's ſafe Arrival in <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament met on the 22<hi>d.</hi> according to their Prorogation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the firſt, all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> march out of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Town of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and our Men take poſſeſſion of it. <note place="margin">The laſt of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> quit the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Town.</note> A great many of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſhipp'd in the River, ſome on Board the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, and others in ſome of our Tranſport-Ships: The number ſhipp'd in the River, and that march'd towards <hi>Cork</hi> this laſt time, is ſaid to be 5650. But thoſe that march'd by Land, ſeveral of them deſerted upon the Road, notwithſtanding the care of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers to ſecure them; for they begun to be ſenſible of the kind Treatment of thoſe that were already returned home, and were ſorry to quit a Country they ſaw already ſo peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

They were for the moſt part too weak for a Conqueſt. 2. When otherwiſe (as in both the Journies of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second,) they were too ſoon broken up, and diſſolved. 3. They were ill paid; and, 4. They were ill Govern'd; a neceſſary Conſequence of the former. Which Inconveniences happen'd, becauſe the King's of <hi>England</hi> for many Ages together were generally otherwiſe imploy'd; either in the Holy-Land, or in <hi>France,</hi> or in their Wars with <hi>Scotland,</hi> or elſe in that unhappy fewd between the two Houſes of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> and <hi>York:</hi> So that they cou'd neither attend the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War in their own Perſons, nor ſpare a Competency either of Men, or Money, to compleat the Work, which was only begun in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second's days,

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the ſtanding Forces were ſeldom or never rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced out of <hi>England</hi> (that is in the times towards the beginning of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government) only the King's Treaſure there was ſpent, and wholly ſpent in the King's ſervice; ſo that in the Reigns of four ſucceſſive Kings, <hi>Viz. Henry</hi> III. <hi>Edward</hi> I. <hi>Edward</hi> II. and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> III. between the Receipts and Allowances, this Entry is commonly found in the <hi>Pipe-Rolls, In Theſauro nihil;</hi> for the Affairs of the State, and thoſe of the Army ſpent <hi>all,</hi> and that <hi>all</hi> was not ſufficient. In the Reign therefore of King <hi>Edward</hi> II. <hi>Maurice Fitz Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> as his Anceſtor was the firſt of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Race that took part with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> againſt his Native Country Men, he being now Commander in Chief of the Army againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> then Invading <hi>Ireland,</hi> he only changed the name of the Ancient <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cuſtom called <hi>Bonaught,</hi> but began to practice the thing it ſelf under the names of <hi>Coigne</hi> and <hi>Livery</hi> and <hi>Pay,</hi> that is, he and his Army took Horſe Meat, and Mans Meat, and alſo Money at their pleaſure, without any ſatisfaction, ſo much as of a Bill. And this afterwards proved the general fault of all the Chief Commanders in this Kingdom, for finding the advantage of this way of proceeding, they begun to oppreſs the Poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> heavily, who rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, would give them a part of their Land to have the reſt free, which Land ſo given the Lords put <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tenants upon, and incouraged them in ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that ſo they might pay their Rent. And then the Kings of <hi>England</hi> not being at leiſure to attend the War in their own Perſons, they could do no leſs in Honour, than give a great part of the Land to thoſe that Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. But thoſe Scopes of Land given at firſt to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Adventurers were generally too large, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:99346:183"/> ſo great, that they begun to ſet up for themſelves, no fealty being reſerved to the Crown by the Tenants, but only to their Lords, which firſt made them Proud, and then Contentious. Upon which account to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their Parties, they Allyed themſelves with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and drew them in to dwell amongſt them, and not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tenants enough for their Lands, they were obliged to take <hi>Iriſh:</hi> By living amongſt whom, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Servants and Nurſes generally of ſuch; they, and their Children, by degrees became of the ſame ſtamp; and having no other means to pay or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Iriſh</hi> that were of their Faction, they ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to take <hi>Coygne,</hi> and <hi>Livery</hi> from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Freeholders, which Oppreſſion was ſo intolerable, as that the better ſort were forced to quit their Free-holds, and flye into <hi>England,</hi> never returning more, though Laws were made in both Kingdoms to remand them, and the reſt that remained, ſoon became degenerate, and meer <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords finding the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Exactions to be more profitable than the Engliſh Rents and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and loving the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tyranny which was tied to no Rules of Law, or Honour, better than a juſt and lawful Seigniory, did reject and caſt off the Engliſh Laws and Government, and ſome with the Iriſh Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms aſſuming their very Names alſo; which Cuſtoms of theirs, were all Enemies to the Engliſh Intereſt in this Countrey.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> had alſo <hi>Coſherings, Viſitations,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes</hi>

Then they had <hi>Goſſipred,</hi> or <hi>Compaternity;</hi> which, tho' by the Canon-Law a Spiritual affinity, yet no Nation ever made ſo Religious account of it as the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> Now theſe,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:99346:184"/> and many other ſuch like Cuſtoms, made ſtrong Parties, and Factions, whereby the Great Men were enabled to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Inferiours, and to oppoſe their Equals.

               <p>Thoſe were the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cuſtoms which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies did embrace, after they had rejected the Civil and Honourable Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which eſpecially fell out in the later end of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, proving of very Fatal Conſequence to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt in that Kingdom; the degenerate <hi>Engliſh</hi> being always harder to ſubdue, than the Natives; for tho' their Minds and Manners were alter'd, yet they had ſo much Engliſh Blood left in their Veins, as gave them Engliſh Courage, and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; whereby the <hi>Fitz Geralds,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s Rebellions were worſe than thoſe of meer <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> proves out of ſeveral Records, that in former times moſt of the Inhabitants were not the King's Tenants, but derived their Titles from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Noblemen, who kept an awe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon them; for tho' the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were formerly owned as Lords of <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet the Lords of <note place="margin">Iriſh <hi>Lords formerly ſtiled Kings.</hi>

               <p>After which ſeveral Attempts were made, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, more or leſs, broke out in every King's Reign. And to omit thoſe of <hi>Perkin Warbeck</hi> and others, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 7. The Rebellion of <hi>Fitz Gerald</hi> and the reſt of that Faction in King <hi>Henry 8th</hi>'s time, in the Year 1535. coſt <hi>England</hi> Forty Thouſand Pounds, a Summ reputed ſo great in thoſe days, and ſo much diſturbed that bluſtering Prince, that he called the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing this Rebellion a <hi>New Conqueſt,</hi> and put the Queſtion to his Council, how <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to bear the Charge of its own preſervation, and whether by Act of Parliament every Man's Eſtate ſhould not be made liable to contribute its proportion? or wehther by Virtue of this <hi>New Conqueſt,</hi> the King might not ſeize on all the Eſtates of that Kingdom Temporal and Spiritual? <hi>Cox</hi> 242.</p>

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:99346:185"/> 
                  <hi>Iriſh</hi> daily gained ground) they brought the Publick into danger. However this Rebellious Spirit continued in <hi>Ireland</hi> all Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, even to the ninth of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, as Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> obſerves; but if he had lived in our days, he wou'd have ſeen good reaſons to ſay <hi>it was always the Genius of the People.</hi> And one Mr. <hi>Lawrence</hi> has ſince that, endeavoured to prove that <hi>Ireland</hi> was never intirely ſubjected to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> nor the Lands properly called the King's Lands, until the Act of Settlement paſſed in the <hi>12th</hi> Year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; for before this, the Chief Inhabitants in all Cities and Towns were Papiſts, as Sheriffs, Juſtices of the Peace, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> by which means that Party was wonderfully encouraged and ſtrengthened; and beſides, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> before the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, were by far the greateſt Proprietors, tho' af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they enjoyed not much above a fifth part of the whole (that is in propriety) by which means, and the induſtrious Management of ſome of the Chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt was very far advanced in this Country before the death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; for tho' ſome Clouds aroſe before, yet the Sun ſhone pretty clear, till the Death of that Monarch made it more than Twilight with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and then the late dark Night of Confuſion approached ſo ſuddenly, that it gave them no time to ſet things in Order, till they cou'd not in a manner ſee where they were a going: This put a full ſtop to the Carreer of all their Proſperity, for a great many conſiderable Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and other Improvements in and about <hi>Dublin,</hi> and other places in the Kingdom, being pretty far advanced at that Juncture, they were left off very abruptly, the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man throwing away his Tools, and the Husbandman neglecting his Plow at the News, as if they had then foreſeen their approaching Miſery, and were amazed to find the <hi>Iriſh</hi> arm ſo faſt on all hands, by which
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:99346:186"/> they were aſſured that other ſorts of Weapons than they had uſed for the Country's improving, were ſoon like to grow more in faſhion, and that to the undoing of what themſelves had ſo honeſtly endeavoured to make up. So that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were not then, nor indeed are as yet ſo ſubdued, as that no further Storm may ever be feared to ariſe from that corner.</p>
               <p>And certainly the not thorowly endeavouring to make <hi>Ireland</hi> bear the Charge of its own preſervation, has in all Ages been very much to the diſadvantage of <note place="margin">Ireland <hi>ſhou'd be put into a Condition to bear its own Burden.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>England.</hi> But to carry this no higher than the Year 1595, the time of <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s Rebellion, which <hi>Cambden</hi> in his Annals tells us coſt 1198717 <hi>l.</hi> to ſuppreſs. Or if we compute the Charge of its firſt Conqueſt, and the ſuppreſſing the ſeveral Rebellions from that time till this of <hi>Tyrone</hi>'s, to coſt but double as much as this did, (as they needs muſt, ſince before that, <hi>Ireland</hi> never enjoyed ſeven Years peace at one time.) Then, I ſay, long e're this, all thoſe Rebellions had been forgot, and the Trade and Product of <hi>Ireland</hi> more than trebly recompenced <hi>England</hi> for her former Blood and Treaſure: But as the Degenerate <hi>Engliſh</hi> grew more and more in love with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and their Cuſtoms, and ſo took their part againſt <hi>England:</hi> The Charges encreaſed to more prodigious Sums; and they generally make uſe of it as a great Argument for what they did of late, that it was the Blood and Treaſure of their Anceſtors that firſt gained that Kingdom to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tho' they differed in Opinion, yet it was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable that they ſhould be quite excluded from ſharing in the Government with thoſe that were of a much later Date. But this Objection is of an older ſtanding than either the former War, or this laſt; for we are told that ſo great Heats have aroſe formerly between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of Birth, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of Blood in <hi>Ireland;</hi> that they held different Parliaments, and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:99346:186"/> endeavoured by all means Poſſible to ruine one another: But 'tis obſerv'd by very Learned Men in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that tho' the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have often fallen out amongſt themſelves, and there were generally found in many places of the Kingdom ſuch of <hi>Engliſh</hi> extraction, as would joyn with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> againſt <hi>England;</hi> yet the People of the Pale were always firm, and Loyal to the Crown, and the greateſt ſtrength that <hi>England</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation (for which they were often plentifully Rewarded) 'till in the Year 1641, they all broke looſe, which they ſay was occaſioned thus.</p>
               <p>Tho ſince the firſt Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> there have been continued feuds in that Kingdom, between the People of both Nations, upon the account, of Intereſt; yet when the Reformation was once ſet on foot, the Breach was widned upon that account, it being what the Natives of that Country have always endeavoured to deſtroy, and with it the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt there; but finding this a very difficult Task, by reaſon that the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> of the Pale, tho' many of them were of the ſame Religion with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> yet they cou'd never be perſwaded to ſtand up for a mere <hi>Iriſh</hi> Intereſt, till the <hi>Iriſh</hi> (in the <note place="margin">

               <p> Tho' its to be obſerved that in the two laſt Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns there died very few except Recruits, and ſuch as died of their Wounds: Nor are we to believe that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did not loſe a great many by Sickneſs alſo, but no doubt the Deſtruction of the People in the Country wou'd do more than double all theſe Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; ſo that by the Sword, Famine, and all other accidents, there has periſhed, ſince firſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> began to play their mad Pranks, there have died, I ſay, in that Kingdom, of one ſort and another, at leaſt One Hundred Thouſand, Young and Old, beſides tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Number that are Ruined and undone.</p>

               <p>But I can carry the matter yet higher, and affirm, that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Intereſt of the Iriſh Papiſts themſelves to Advance the Power of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> it's the real Intereſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of <hi>Ireland</hi> themſelves, whether of <hi>Iriſh</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Extraction, to promote that of <hi>England</hi> as much as they can in their Country, if they will but conſult the future ſafety of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Poſterity; ſince without the ſupport of ſome other Nation they can never hope of themſelves to be an Independant Kingdom; and if they were, we ſcarcely can find out how they wou'd agree amongſt themſelves, who ſhould Command, or who Obey, which they never could yet from the beginning do; and what did the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ever get by accompanying either their Lords or Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers into Rebellion? Or what ſhould they have gotten if the late Attempt had abſolutely ſucceded, but a more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Servitude under the <hi>French?</hi> And therefore it's bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to have their old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Friends they have been ſo long acquainted with, than run the hazard of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſetting up new Tyrants of their own, or having them come to 'em from abroad.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt were ſtrong and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in <hi>Ireland,</hi> this wou'd cut off the hopes of all diſaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed People for ever thinking to withſtand it, and wou'd make them reject all Tenders from abroad, and Intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from their Jeſuited Prieſts at home, and never wou'd they more run ſuch deſperate Risks which ſtill fall upon their own heads at laſt; ſo that if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt were ſo fortified, that all hopes of removing it were cut off, the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> would not be prevailed upon to make ſuch deſtructive attempts to themſelves and Poſterities, as they often have done hitherto by the Inſinuations of their Prieſts, who have nothing to loſe, nor Families to provide for, but only hazard the Lives and Fortunes of others that have both.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:99346:190"/> Since (as Sir <hi>William Petty</hi> obſerves) <hi>there are, and ever will be in</hi> England <hi>Men ready for any Exploit and Change, either by being diſcontented with their preſent Condition, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways well inclined to the ſervice, more than are ſufficient to quell any Inſurrection which the</hi> Iriſh <hi>can make and abide by:</hi> Which wou'd ſpare both the Blood and Treaſure of <hi>England,</hi> if thoſe of that Nation in <hi>Ireland,</hi> cou'd do it of themſelves.</p>
               <p>There are only two Objections that I know of, which <note place="margin">Two Objections anſwered.</note> ſeem to be conſiderable againſt this Opinion of promoting the Trade and Wealth of <hi>Ireland:</hi> The firſt, that if <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould be encouraged ſo far as to make it altogether an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Country, it would drain the wealth and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>England</hi> to that degree, that we ſhould impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh our ſelves, by putting our Trade into their hands, who wou'd be equal, if not Superiour to us in a ſmall time, ſince their Country lies as Convenient in all reſpects for Trade as ours, and has ſeveral Advantages above it. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This would rather incourage <hi>England</hi> to be more indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious in Trade and Manufactures, when they ſaw their younger Siſter of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by having the ſame priviledges of Trade with her ſelf, begin to contend with her in this particular, and would create a profitable emulation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the People of both Kingdoms; ſince I have not that Opinion of Trade, that ſome People have of Motion; that there's a determinate quantity, and when it fails in one place, it increaſes in another. There is Trade e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough no doubt abroad in the World for them all, if they will but be Induſtrious; however, there can no diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage accrue either to the King of <hi>England,</hi> or his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general, by having this effected, nay, this wou'd ſoon be more for the advantage of the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> than any poor Cuſtoms that are got by dividing the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can ever amount to; for who ſees not the good effects of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> between <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then thoſe who are ſo hardy as to leave <hi>England,</hi> and venture their Lives and Fortunes at any time, for
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:99346:190"/> the reducing of <hi>Ireland,</hi> if they ſurvive it, and once come to ſettle there, they are ſo far from having En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Trade and grow Rich, that by ſeveral Laws made on the account of Trade, they are under the ſame Circumſtances with the Conquered <hi>Iriſh</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of that Kingdom really are in the point of all the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Trade eſpecially.</p>
               <p>The other Objection is, That if <hi>Ireland</hi> were ſo far encouraged in Trade and other Advantages, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come abſolutely an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Country, and equally En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the Benefit of its Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the People there, after ſome time wou'd grow Rich, and conſequently Proud, ſo that they wou'd then ſet up for themſelves, and deny all manner of dependance upon <hi>England,</hi> which would ſoon create a more dangerous Civil War than ever. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> There can be no fear of this, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing cou'd be got by ſuch a Revolt, but their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and it's as probable, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſhould upon any diſguſt endeavour to ſet up for themſelves, which they are ſenſible could bring nothing but Ruin to the whole: Beſides, ſince the Royal Seats of the Kings, the Principal Courts of Judicature, and alſo the Royal Navy are always on this ſide the Water, all Attempts of this kind wou'd prove vain and fruitleſs, and the reſt of the World laugh at ſuch a Deſtructive folly and madneſs.</p>
               <p>I pretend not to meddle with any particular Methods, <note place="margin">Religion in the firſt Place to be taken care of.</note> for the promoting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> only it's worth the Knowledge, and Care of every one, eſpecially thoſe in places of Authority and Truſt; what was in my Lord <hi>Barkley</hi>'s Inſtructions (Dated <hi>May</hi> 21 (1670.) relating to Matters of Religion. <hi>That foraſmuch as all good Succeſs doth reſt upon the Service of God, above all things you are to ſettle good Orders in the Church, that God may be better ſerved in the True Eſtabliſhed Religion, and the People by that means reduc'd from their Errors.</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:99346:191"/> But whilſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are in the Power of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy, they keep them in ſuch Awe and Ignorance, that they ſcarce dare, or can enquire into the differences in Religion, nor Read the Scriptures, or yet confer with any Proteſtant Divine, ſo that all they generally know of Religion (I ſpeak of the Vulgar Sort) is ſome Fabulous Legends of the Prieſts Invention, or that their Fathers or Families were of that Perſuaſion, and ſo muſt they be alſo: But tho' they be much given to Lying, yet they are not in the main ſo ill-natured as ſome People make them, ſince they own our Baptiſm and other Inſtitutions to be Eſſential, and will of their own accords come to us, when they have not the conveniency of a Prieſt, ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of which, I could give of my own Knowledge.</p>
               <p>There are a great many very Learned, Pious, and Devout Clergymen of the Proteſtant Church in <hi>Ireland,</hi> diſcharging the Duties of their Function, with ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Godly Sincerity, as becomes the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Chriſt: But there being a great many Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations in that Kingdom; and by this means, half a ſcore Pariſhes in ſome places, not able to afford one Hundred Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> to a Miniſter, this has given occaſion for the Union of ſeveral Pariſhes, and not only ſo, but for frequent Pluralities, and that in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, very much to the diſadvantage of the Church, by which means there are a great many Pariſhes Inhabited only with Papiſts, which for that Reaſon are generally called <hi>Sine Cures,</hi> as if the Miniſter had no Buſineſs there at all. But this I can by no means Subſcribe unto, ſince to me they ſeem to be the clean contrary, and not impoſſible to remedy, by finding out ſome means to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low each Miniſter a Competency, and then oblige him to reſide upon it, whether his Pariſhioners be <hi>Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> ſince the Living among thoſe People, and the frequent Converſation with them, wou'd be of more force than all the Penal Laws in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>

               <p> There was a view of <hi>Ireland,</hi> writ by <hi>Spencer,</hi> as I take it, towards the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, and amongſt other things, he has this Remarque. <hi>Several</hi> Iriſh <hi>Families</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are already become</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, <hi>and more would, if the</hi> Engliſh <hi>would do their parts, in ſupplying the Country with Learned, Pious, and painful Preachers, who cou'd Out-Preach, and Out-Live the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Prieſts: For Religion muſt not be forcibly impoſed upon them with Terrors and ſharp Penalties (as now is the manner) but rather delivered and intimated with Mildneſs and Gentleneſs, ſo as it may not be hated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be underſtood, which yet is not ſo difficult a Task as ſome People make it, for if the Ancient Godly Fathers, who firſt Converted them, when they were Infidels, to the Faith, were able to pull th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m from Idolatry and Paganiſm, to the true Belief of Chriſt (as St.</hi> Patrick <hi>and St.</hi> Columb) <hi>how much more eaſily ſhall Godly Teachers bring them to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of that, which they already Profeſs; if they did but ſhew as much Zeal in diſſwading them from their Errors, as the Prieſts do Care and Induſtry to keep them in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, thus far <hi>Spencer</hi> ſeems to be in the right of it; That True Religion is not to be planted by Penal Laws, or the Terrour of Puniſhment, which may fill a Church with Temporizing Hypocrites, but never with Sincere Profeſſors; for tho' Humane Laws are a good Hedge about Religion, and an Encouragement to Vertue, yet that which is ſolely founded upon ſuch, binds the Conſcience no longer than thoſe Laws are in force.</p>
               <p>But what I am ſorry to ſee ſo true, is, that <hi>Idleneſs</hi> is the <hi>malus</hi> Genius of that Kingdom, and except you can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the People to be Induſtrious too, as well as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, you are not much nearer the matter, for they are Naturally a lazy Crew, and love nothing ſo much as their eaſe, and if an <hi>Iriſhman</hi> has but a Cow and a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoe Garden, it's all the Wealth he commonly aſpires to;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:99346:192"/> which way of Feeding, a great many give for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that they are generally ſo mean ſpirited, for you'll ſee them in Companies lye loytering in the Streets of any Country Village, or by the High-way ſides, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after, and telling News to one another, but not one in twenty, either at work in the Fields, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Honeſtly imploy'd, which is the Reaſon, that at this very day, moſt of the Goals of the Kingdom are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Thieves, and the Streets with incredible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of importunate houling Beggars, who yet moſt of them had rather Live ſo than otherways.</p>
               <p>But I'm afraid, a great many People will think I have been too buſie, and therefore I have only this to ſay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that notwithſtanding all the Wagers, that have been proffer'd of late, whether <hi>Ireland</hi> would not be in the <hi>French</hi> King's Hands by ſuch a time; I dare freely venture one of as great value as I am able, that tho' he begin to morrow, it will not be in his Power, with all the Force he can ſpare to take it, from that handful of Men left in that Kingdom for its ſecurity, theſe Seven Years, for if the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who were but indifferently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for at beſt, were able to hold it out ſo long, againſt all the Power and Strength of <hi>England;</hi> what can Men that have better Supplies, and full as good Hearts do?</p>
               <p>And as for thoſe vain hopes of that unhappy Party, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>An Invaſion from</hi> France <hi>upon any of the three Kingdoms not very practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable at this time.</hi>
                  </note> who are ſtill buoyed up with the Fancy of the <hi>French</hi> King's Greatneſs, and that he will at ſome time or other, certainly make an Invaſion, either upon <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or <hi>Ireland;</hi> any who know what War means, can aſſure them, that it's much ſooner ſaid than done. For if his preſent Majeſty of <hi>England,</hi> was obliged to imploy nigh 600 Veſſels, when at his firſt coming he Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported only 14000 Men into this Kingdom; and if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> War has for Three Years paſt, imployed ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of Tranſport Ships in that narrow Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which lye ſo conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:99346:192"/> and contiguous one to another; what Proviſion muſt needs be made in <hi>France</hi> for ſuch an Attempt, as an Invaſion upon any of the Three Kingdoms, which if it miſcarries, they are certainly undone? For ſuppoſe the <hi>French</hi> ſtill a match for our Fleet (which I hope they will never be now whilſt the World ſtands) and the <hi>French</hi> Invaſion deſigned upon <hi>England,</hi> tho' there be a Factious and unnaturally diſcontented Party there, that are no well wiſhers to the preſent Government, vet there are ſo many Loyal and True Hearted <hi>Engliſh-Men</hi> ſtill left at home, that all the Ships in <hi>France</hi> are not able to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport Men enough from thence to ſubdue them, ſince we know their affection to both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> that are with them, ſhould they once indeavour to look into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whoſe Strength is in the Hearts and Affections of the People, intirely devoted to Their Majeſties Service.</p>
               <p>I allow that 20000 well Diſciplin'd and Experienc'd Men are able to beat four times the number of Raw un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienc'd Country People, but then I leave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtanding Army, and a well Diſciplined Militia, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> to ſhew how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome the <hi>French</hi> wou'd be to them.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Scotland,</hi> its Soyl in moſt places is Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally poor and barren, and an Army of Foreigners Landed there, muſt either eat Heath or one another in a ſmall time, if once they leave the Coaſt; for admit they have Proviſions brought by Sea into their Harbours, yet the Country in few places is ſo level as to admit of either a marching Train of Artillery, or of Proviſion Waggons, which an Army has no Buſineſs any where without, and ſoon wou'd look very fooliſh for want of, ſuppoſe but an indifferent Enemy to oppoſe them.</p>
               <p>Then as for an Invaſion to be made upon <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Country is already ſo deſtroyed by being the Seat of War, that whoſoever attempts it, muſt bring all from abroad likewiſe, as well Horſes as Proviſions, which is
